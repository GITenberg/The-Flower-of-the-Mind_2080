<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Partial</span> collections of English
poems, decided by a common subject or bounded by narrow dates and
periods of literary history, are made at very short intervals,
and the makers are safe from the reproach of proposing their own
personal taste as a guide for the reading of others.&nbsp; But a
general Anthology gathered from the whole of English
literature&mdash;the whole from Chaucer to Wordsworth&mdash;by a
gatherer intent upon nothing except the quality of poetry, is a
more rare enterprise.&nbsp; It is hardly to be made without
tempting the suspicion&mdash;nay, hardly without seeming to
hazard the confession&mdash;of some measure of
self-confidence.&nbsp; Nor can even the desire to enter upon that
labour be a frequent one&mdash;the desire of the heart of one for
whom poetry is veritably &lsquo;the complementary life&rsquo; to
set up a pale for inclusion and exclusion, to add honours, to
multiply homage, to cherish, to restore, to protest, to proclaim,
to depose; and to gain the consent of a multitude of readers to
all those acts.&nbsp; Many years, then&mdash;some part of a
century&mdash;may easily pass between the publication of one
general anthology and the making of another.</p>
<p>The enterprise would be a sorry one if it were really
arbitrary, and if an anthologist should give effect to passionate
preferences without authority.&nbsp; An anthology that shall have
any <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>value
must be made on the responsibility of one but on the authority of
many.&nbsp; There is no caprice; the mind of the maker has been
formed for decision by the wisdom of many instructors.&nbsp; It
is the very study of criticism, and the grateful and profitable
study, that gives the justification to work done upon the
strongest personal impulse, and done, finally, in the mental
solitude that cannot be escaped at the last.&nbsp; In another
order, moral education would be best crowned if it proved to have
quick and profound control over the first impulses; its finished
work would be to set the soul in a state of law, delivered from
the delays of self-distrust; not action only, but the desires
would be in an old security, and a wish would come to light
already justified.&nbsp; This would be the second&mdash;if it
were not the only&mdash;liberty.&nbsp; Even so an intellectual
education might assuredly confer freedom upon first and solitary
thoughts, and confidence and composure upon the sallies of
impetuous courage.&nbsp; In a word, it should make a studious
anthologist quite sure about genius.&nbsp; And all who have
bestowed, or helped in bestowing, the liberating education have
given their student the authority to be free.&nbsp; Personal and
singular the choice in such a book must be, not without
right.</p>
<p>Claiming and disclaiming so much, the gatherers may follow one
another to harvest, and glean in the same fields in different
seasons, for the repetition of the work can never be altogether a
repetition.&nbsp; The general consent of criticism does not stand
still; and moreover, a mere accident <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>has until now left a poet of genius
of the past here and there to neglect or obscurity.&nbsp; This is
not very likely to befall again; the time has come when there is
little or nothing left to discover or rediscover in the sixteenth
century or the seventeenth; we know that there does not lurk
another Crashaw contemned, or another Henry Vaughan disregarded,
or another George Herbert misplaced.&nbsp; There is now something
like finality of knowledge at least; and therefore not a little
error in the past is ready to be repaired.&nbsp; This is the
result of time.&nbsp; Of the slow actions and reactions of
critical taste there might be something to say, but nothing
important.&nbsp; No loyal anthologist perhaps will consent to
acknowledge these tides; he will hardly do his work well unless
he believe it to be stable and perfect; nor, by the way, will he
judge worthily in the name of others unless he be resolved to
judge intrepidly for himself.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as even the best of all poems are the best upon
innumerable degrees, the size of most anthologies has gone far to
decide what degrees are to be gathered in and what left
without.&nbsp; The best might make a very small volume, and be
indeed the best, or a very large volume, and be still indeed the
best.&nbsp; But my labour has been to do somewhat
differently&mdash;to gather nothing that did not overpass a
certain boundary-line of genius.&nbsp; Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i>,
for instance, would rightly be placed at the head of everything
below that mark.&nbsp; It is, in fact, so near to the work of
genius as to be most directly, closely, and immediately rebuked
by genius; it meets genius at close quarters and <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>almost
deserves that Shakespeare himself should defeat it.&nbsp;
Mediocrity said its own true word in the <i>Elegy</i>:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Full many a flower is born to blush
unseen,<br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But greatness had said its own word also in a sonnet:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The summer flower is to the summer
sweet<br />
Though to itself it only live and die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reproof here is too sure; not always does it touch so
quick, but it is not seldom manifest, and it makes exclusion a
simple task.&nbsp; Inclusion, on the other hand, cannot be so
completely fulfilled.&nbsp; The impossibility of taking in poems
of great length, however purely lyrical, is a mechanical barrier,
even on the plan of the present volume; in the case of
Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Prothalamion</i>, the unmanageably
autobiographical and local passage makes it inappropriate; some
exquisite things of Landor&rsquo;s are lyrics in blank verse, and
the necessary rule against blank verse shuts them out.&nbsp; No
extracts have been made from any poem, but in a very few
instances a stanza or a passage has been dropped out.&nbsp; No
poem has been put in for the sake of a single perfectly fine
passage; it would be too much to say that no poem has been put in
for the sake of two splendid passages or so.&nbsp; The Scottish
ballad poetry is represented by examples that are to my mind
finer than anything left out; still, it is but represented; and
as the song of this multitude of unknown poets overflows by its
quantity a collection of lyrics of genius, so does <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>severally the
song of Wordsworth, Crashaw, and Shelley.&nbsp; It has been
necessary, in considering traditional songs of evidently mingled
authorship, to reject some one invaluable stanza or
burden&mdash;the original and ancient surviving matter of a
spoilt song&mdash;because it was necessary to reject the sequel
that has cumbered it since some sentimentalist took it for his
own.&nbsp; An example, which makes the heart ache, is that burden
of keen and remote poetry:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O the broom, the bonnie, bonnie
broom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The broom of Cowdenknowes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps some hand will gather all such precious fragments as
these together one day, freed from what is alien in the work of
the restorer.&nbsp; It is inexplicable that a generation resolved
to forbid the restoration of ancient buildings should approve the
eighteenth century restoration of ancient poems; nay, the
architectural &lsquo;restorer&rsquo; is immeasurably the more
respectful.&nbsp; In order to give us again the ancient
fragments, it is happily not necessary to break up the composite
songs which, since the time of Burns, have gained a national
love.&nbsp; Let them be, but let the old verses be also; and let
them have, for those who desire it, the solitariness of their
state of ruin.&nbsp; Even in the cases&mdash;and they are not
few&mdash;where Burns is proved to have given beauty and music to
the ancient fragment itself, his work upon the old stanza is
immeasurably finer than his work in his own new stanzas
following, and it would be less than impiety to part the two.</p>
<p><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>I have
obeyed a profound conviction which I have reason to hope will be
more commended in the future than perhaps it can be now, in
leaving aside a multitude of composite songs&mdash;anachronisms,
and worse than mere anachronisms, as I think them to be, for they
patch wild feeling with sentiment of the sentimentalist.&nbsp;
There are some exceptions.&nbsp; The one fine stanza of a song
which both Sir Walter Scott and Burns restored is given with the
restorations of both, those restorations being severally
beautiful; and the burden, &lsquo;Hame, hame, hame,&rsquo; is
printed with the Jacobite song that carries it; this song seems
so mingled and various in date and origin that no apology is
needed for placing it amongst the bundle of Scottish ballads of
days before the Jacobites.&nbsp; <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> is
treated here as an ancient song.&nbsp; It is to be noted that the
modern, or comparatively modern, additions to old songs full of
quantitative metre&mdash;&lsquo;Hame, hame, hame,&rsquo; is one
of these&mdash;full of long notes, rests, and interlinear pauses,
are almost always written in anap&aelig;sts.&nbsp; The later
writer has slipped away from the fine, various, and subtle metre
of the older.&nbsp; Assuredly the popularity of the metre which,
for want of a term suiting the English rules of verse, must be
called anap&aelig;stic, has done more than any other thing to
vulgarise the national sense of rhythm and to silence the finer
rhythms.&nbsp; Anap&aelig;sts came quite suddenly into English
poetry and brought coarseness, glibness, volubility, dapper and
fatuous effects.&nbsp; A master may use it well, but as a popular
measure it has been disastrous.&nbsp; I <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>would be
bound to find the modern stanzas in an old song by this very
habit of anap&aelig;sts and this very misunderstanding of the
long words and interlinear pauses of the older stanzas.&nbsp;
This, for instance, is the old metre:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Hame, hame, hame!&nbsp; O hame fain wad
I be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>and this the lamentable anap&aelig;stic line (from the same
song):</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Yet the sun through the mirk seems to
promise to me&mdash;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It has been difficult to refuse myself the delight of
including <i>A Divine Love</i> of Carew, but it seemed too bold
to leave out four stanzas of a poem of seven, and the last four
are of the poorest argument.&nbsp; This passage at least shall
speak for the first three:</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thou
didst appear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A glorious mystery, so dark, so clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Nature did
intend<br />
All should confess, but none might comprehend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From <i>Christ&rsquo;s Victory in Heaven</i> of Giles Fletcher
(out of reach for its length) it is a happiness to extract here
at least the passage upon &lsquo;Justice,&rsquo; who looks
&lsquo;as the eagle</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that
hath so oft compared<br />
Her eye with heaven&rsquo;s&rsquo;;</p>
<p>from Marlowe&rsquo;s poem, also unmanageable, that in which
Love ran to the priestess</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And laid his childish head upon her
breast&rsquo;;</p>
<p><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>with
that which tells how Night,</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;deep-drenched
in misty Acheron,<br />
Heaved up her head, and half the world upon<br />
Breathed darkness forth&rsquo;;</p>
<p>from Robert Greene two lines of a lovely passage:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Cupid abroad was lated in the night,<br
/>
His wings were wet with ranging in the rain&rsquo;;</p>
<p>from Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Hue and Cry</i> (not throughout
fine) the stanza:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Beauties, have ye seen a toy,<br />
Called Love, a little boy,<br />
Almost naked, wanton, blind;<br />
Cruel now, and then as kind?<br />
If he be amongst ye, say;<br />
He is Venus&rsquo; run-away&rsquo;;</p>
<p>from Francis Davison:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Her angry eyes are great with
tears&rsquo;;</p>
<p>from George Wither:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I
can go rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her sweet breast<br />
That is the pride of Cynthia&rsquo;s train&rsquo;;</p>
<p>from Cowley:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Return, return, gay planet of mine
east&rsquo;!</p>
<p>The poems in which these are cannot make part of the volume,
but the citation of the fragments is a relieving act of love.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, Skelton&rsquo;s song to &lsquo;Mistress
Margery Wentworth&rsquo; had almost taken a place; but its charm
is hardly fine enough.&nbsp; If it is necessary to answer the
inevitable <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>question in regard to Byron, let me say that in
another Anthology, a secondary Anthology, the one in which
Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i> would have an honourable place, some
more of Byron&rsquo;s lyrics would certainly be found; and except
this there is no apology.&nbsp; If the last stanza of the
&lsquo;Dying Gladiator&rsquo; passage, or the last stanza on the
cascade rainbow at Terni,</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Love watching madness with unalterable
mien,&rsquo;</p>
<p>had been separate poems instead of parts of <i>Childe
Harold</i>, they would have been amongst the poems that are here
collected in no spirit of arrogance, or of caprice, of diffidence
or doubt.</p>
<p>The volume closes some time before the middle of the century
and the death of Wordsworth.</p>

<h3>VERSES BEFORE DEATH</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Even</span> such is time,
that takes in trust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our youth, our joys, our all we have,<br />
And pays us but with earth and dust;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, in the dark and silent grave,<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>When we have
wandered all our ways,<br />
Shuts up the story of our days;<br />
But from this earth, this grave, this dust,<br />
My God shall raise me up, I trust!</p>
<h2>EDMUND SPENSER<br />
<span class="GutSmall">1553&ndash;1599</span></h2>
<h3>EASTER</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Most</span> glorious Lord
of life! that on this day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Didst make thy triumph over death and sin;<br />
And, having harrowed hell, didst bring away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Captivity then captive, us to win:<br />
This glorious day, dear Lord, with joy begin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And grant that we, for whom thou diddest die,<br />
Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May live for ever in felicity!</p>
<p class="poetry">And that thy love we weighing worthily,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May likewise love thee for the same again;<br />
And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With love may one another entertain.<br />
So let us love, dear Love, like as we ought;<br />
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.</p>
<h3>FRESH SPRING</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Fresh</span> Spring, the
herald of love&rsquo;s mighty king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In whose coat-armour richly are displayed<br />
All sorts of flowers, the which on earth do spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In goodly colours gloriously arrayed:<br />
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Go to my
love, where she is careless laid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in her winter bower not well awake;<br />
Tell her the joyous time will not be stayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless she do him by the forelock take;</p>
<p class="poetry">Bid her therefore herself soon ready make,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wait on Love amongst his lovely crew;<br />
Where every one that misseth there her make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be by him amerced with penance due.<br />
Make haste therefore, sweet love, whilst it is prime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For none can call again the passed time.</p>
<h3>LIKE AS A SHIP</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Like</span> as a ship, that
through the ocean wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By conduct of some star doth make her way,<br />
When, as a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of her course doth wander far astray!<br />
So I, whose star, that wont with her bright ray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me to direct, with clouds is overcast,<br />
Do wander now, in darkness and dismay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through hidden perils round about me placed;</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet hope I well that, when this storm is
past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Helice, the loadstar of my life,<br />
Will shine again, and look on me at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With lovely light to clear my cloudy grief:<br />
Till then I wander, careful, comfortless,<br />
In secret sorrow and sad pensiveness.</p>
<h3>EPITHALAMION</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ye</span> learned sisters,
which have oftentimes<br />
Been to me aiding, others to adorn,<br />
Whom ye thought worthy of your graceful rhymes,<br />
That even the greatest did not greatly scorn<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>To hear
their names sung in your simple lays,<br />
But joyed in their praise;<br />
And when ye list your own mishaps to mourn,<br />
Which death, or love, or fortune&rsquo;s wreck did raise,<br />
Your string could soon to sadder tenor turn,<br />
And teach the woods and waters to lament<br />
Your doleful dreariment:<br />
Now lay those sorrowful complaints aside;<br />
And, having all your heads with garlands crowned,<br />
Help me mine own love&rsquo;s praises to resound;<br />
Ne let the same of any be envied:<br />
So Orpheus did for his own bride!<br />
So I unto myself alone will sing;<br />
The woods shall to me answer, and my echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Early, before the world&rsquo;s light-giving
lamp<br />
His golden beam upon the hills doth spread,<br />
Having dispersed the night&rsquo;s uncheerful damp,<br />
Do ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-head,<br />
Go to the bower of my beloved love,<br />
My truest turtle dove;<br />
Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,<br />
And long since ready forth his mask to move,<br />
With his bright tead that names with many a flake,<br />
And many a bachelor to wait on him,<br />
In their fresh garments trim.<br />
Bid her awake therefore, and soon her dight,<br />
For lo! the wished day is come at last,<br />
That shall, for all the pains and sorrows past,<br />
Pay to her usury of long delight:<br />
And, whilst she doth her dight,<br />
Do ye to her of joy and solace sing,<br />
That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Bring with you all the Nymphs that you can hear<br />
Both of the rivers and the forests green,<br />
And of the sea that neighbours to her near:<br />
All with gay garlands goodly well beseen.<br />
And let them also with them bring in hand<br />
Another gay garland,<br />
For my fair love, of lilies and of roses,<br />
Bound truelove wise, with a blue silk riband.<br />
And let them make great store of bridal posies,<br />
And let them eke bring store of other flowers,<br />
To deck the bridal bowers.<br />
And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,<br />
For fear the stones her tender foot should wrong,<br />
Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,<br />
And diapred like the discoloured mead.<br />
Which done, do at her chamber door await,<br />
For she will waken straight;<br />
The whiles do ye this song unto her sing,<br />
The woods shall to you answer, and your echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye Nymphs of Mulla, which with careful heed<br
/>
The silver scaly trouts do tend full well,<br />
And greedy pikes which use therein to feed<br />
(Those trouts and pikes all others do excel);<br />
And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake,<br />
Where none do fishes take;<br />
Bind up the locks the which hang scattered light,<br />
And in his waters, which your mirror make,<br />
Behold your faces as the crystal bright,<br />
That when you come whereas my love doth lie,<br />
No blemish she may spy.<br />
And eke, ye lightfoot maids, which keep the door,<br />
That on the hoary mountain used to tower;<br />
And the wild wolves, which seek them to devour,<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>With your
steel darts do chase from coming near;<br />
Be also present here,<br />
To help to deck her, and to help to sing,<br />
That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time:<br />
The Rosy Morn long since left Tithon&rsquo;s bed,<br />
All ready to her silver coach to climb;<br />
And Ph&oelig;bus &rsquo;gins to show his glorious head.<br />
Hark! how the cheerful birds do chant their lays<br />
And carol of love&rsquo;s praise.<br />
The merry Lark her matins sings aloft;<br />
The Thrush replies; the Mavis descant plays:<br />
The Ouzel shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;<br />
So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,<br />
To this day&rsquo;s merriment.<br />
Ah! my dear love, why do ye sleep thus long,<br />
When meeter were that ye should now awake,<br />
T&rsquo; await the coming of your joyous make,<br />
And hearken to the birds&rsquo; love-learned song,<br />
The dewy leaves among?<br />
For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,<br />
That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">My love is now awake out of her dreams,<br />
And her fair eyes, like stars that dimmed were<br />
With darksome cloud, now show their goodly beams<br />
More bright than Hesperus his head doth rear.<br />
Come now, ye damsels, daughters of delight,<br />
Help quickly her to dight!<br />
But first come, ye fair hours, which were begot,<br />
In Jove&rsquo;s sweet paradise, of Day and Night;<br />
Which do the seasons of the year allot,<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>And all,
that ever in this world is fair,<br />
Do make and still repair:<br />
And ye three handmaids of the Cyprian Queen,<br />
The which do still adorn her beauty&rsquo;s pride,<br />
Help to adorn my beautifullest bride:<br />
And, as ye her array, still throw between<br />
Some graces to be seen;<br />
And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,<br />
The whiles the woods shall answer, and your echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now is my love all ready forth to come:<br />
Let all the virgins therefore well await:<br />
And ye, fresh boys, that tend upon her groom,<br />
Prepare yourselves, for he is coming straight.<br />
Set all your things in seemly good array,<br />
Fit for so joyful day:<br />
The joyfullest day that ever Sun did see.<br />
Fair Sun! show forth thy favourable ray,<br />
And let thy life-full heat not fervent be,<br />
For fear of burning her sunshiny face,<br />
Her beauty to disgrace.<br />
O fairest Ph&oelig;bus! father of the Muse!<br />
If ever I did honour thee aright,<br />
Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,<br />
Do not thy servant&rsquo;s simple boon refuse;<br />
But let this day, let this one day, be mine;<br />
Let all the rest be thine.<br />
Then I thy sovereign praises loud will sing,<br />
That all the woods shall answer, and their echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hark! how the minstrels &rsquo;gin to shrill
aloud<br />
Their merry Music that resounds from far,<br />
The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling crowd,<br />
That well agree withouten breach or jar.<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>But, most of
all, the damsels do delight<br />
When they their timbrels smite,<br />
And thereunto do dance and carol sweet,<br />
That all the senses they do ravish quite;<br />
The whiles the boys run up and down the street,<br />
Crying aloud with strong confused noise,<br />
As if it were one voice,<br />
Hymen! i&ouml; Hymen!&nbsp; Hymen, they do shout;<br />
That even to the heavens their shouting shrill<br />
Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;<br />
To which the people standing all about,<br />
As in approvance, do thereto applaud,<br />
And loud advance her laud;<br />
And evermore they Hymen, Hymen! sing,<br />
That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lo! where she comes along with portly pace,<br
/>
Like Ph&oelig;be, from her chamber of the East,<br />
Arising forth to run her mighty race,<br />
Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best.<br />
So well it her beseems, that ye would ween<br />
Some angel she had been.<br />
Her long loose yellow locks like golden wire,<br />
Sprinkled with pearl, and pearling flowers atween,<br />
Do like a golden mantle her attire;<br />
And, being crowned with a garland green,<br />
Seem like some maiden Queen.<br />
Her modest eyes, abashed to behold<br />
So many gazers as on her do stare,<br />
Upon the lowly ground affixed are;<br />
Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,<br />
But blush to hear her praises sung so loud,<br />
So far from being proud.<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Nathless, do
ye still loud her praises sing,<br />
That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tell me, ye merchants&rsquo; daughters, did ye
see<br />
So fair a creature in your town before;<br />
So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,<br />
Adorned with beauty&rsquo;s grace and virtue&rsquo;s store?<br />
Her goodly eyes like sapphires shining bright,<br />
Her forehead ivory white,<br />
Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath ruddied,<br />
Her lips like cherries charming men to bite,<br />
Her breast like to a bowl of cream uncrudded,<br />
Her paps like lilies budded,<br />
Her snowy neck like to a marble tower;<br />
And all her body like a palace fair,<br />
Ascending up, with many a stately stair,<br />
To honour&rsquo;s seat and chastity&rsquo;s sweet bower.<br />
Why stand ye still, ye virgins, in amaze,<br />
Upon her so to gaze,<br />
Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,<br />
To which the woods did answer, and your echo ring?</p>
<p class="poetry">But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,<br />
The inward beauty of her lively spright,<br />
Garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree,<br />
Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,<br />
And stand astonished like to those which read<br />
Medusa&rsquo;s mazeful head.<br />
There dwells sweet love, and constant chastity,<br />
Unspotted faith, and comely womanhood,<br />
Regard of honour, and mild modesty;<br />
There virtue reigns as Queen in royal throne,<br />
And giveth laws alone,<br />

For to receive this Saint with honour due,<br />
That cometh in to you.<br />
With trembling steps, and humble reverence,<br />
She cometh in before th&rsquo; Almighty&rsquo;s view;<br />

The choristers the joyous anthem sing,<br />

Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks,<br />

About the sacred altar do remain,<br />
Forget their service and about her fly,<br />
Oft peeping in her face, that seems more fair,<br />
The more they on it stare.<br />
But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,<br />
Are governed with goodly modesty,<br />
That suffers not one look to glance awry,<br />
Which may let in a little thought unsound.<br />
Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,<br />
The pledge of all our band?<br />
Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluja sing,<br />

Make sudden sad affrights;<br />
Ne let house-fires, nor lightning&rsquo;s helpless harms,<br />
Ne let the Pouke, nor other evil sprights,<br />
Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,<br />
Ne let hobgoblins, names whose sense we see not,<br />
Fray us with things that be not:<br />
Let not the shriek-owl nor the stork be heard,<br />
Nor the night raven, that still deadly yells;<br />
Nor damned ghosts, called up with mighty spells,<br />
Nor grisly vultures, make us once afeard:<br />
Ne let the unpleasant choir of frogs still croaking<br />
Make us to wish their choking!<br />
Let none of these their dreary accents sing;<br />

O, &rsquo;tis the ravished nightingale!<br />
&lsquo;Jug, jug, jug, jug, tereu,&rsquo; she cries,<br />
And still her woes at midnight rise.<br />
Brave prick-song! who is&rsquo;t now we hear?<br />
None but the lark so shrill and clear;<br />
Now at heaven&rsquo;s gate she claps her wings,<br />
The morn not waking till she sings.<br />
Hark, hark, with what a pretty throat<br />
Poor robin-redbreast tunes his note;<br />
Hark, how the jolly cuckoos sing!<br />
Cuckoo to welcome in the spring,<br />
Cuckoo to welcome in the spring!</p>

<h3>TRUE LOVE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> true-love hath my
heart, and I have his,<br />
By just exchange one for the other given:<br />
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss,<br />
There never was a better bargain driven:<br />
His heart in me keeps him and me in one,<br />
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:<br />
He loves my heart, for once it was his own,<br />
I cherish his because in me it bides:<br />
His heart his wound received from my sight;<br />
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;<br />
For as from me on him his hurt did light,<br />
So still methought in me his hurt did smart:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both, equal hurt, in this change sought our
bliss.<br />

<h3>THE MOON</h3>

O Moon, thou climb&rsquo;st the skies!<br />
How silently, and with how wan a face!<br />
What, may it be that e&rsquo;en in heavenly place<br />
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!<br />
Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes<br />
Can judge of love, thou feel&rsquo;st a lover&rsquo;s case;<br />
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace,<br />
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Then,
e&rsquo;en of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,<br />
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?<br />
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?<br />
Do they above love to be loved, and yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they call virtue, there, ungratefulness?</p>
<h3>KISS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Love</span> still a boy and
oft a wanton is,<br />
Schooled only by his mother&rsquo;s tender eye;<br />
What wonder, then, if he his lesson miss,<br />
When for so soft a rod dear play he try?<br />
And yet my Star, because a sugared kiss<br />
In sport I sucked while she asleep did lie,<br />
Doth lower, nay chide, nay threat, for only this.&mdash;<br />
Sweet, it was saucy Love, not humble I!<br />
But no &rsquo;scuse serves; she makes her wrath appear<br />
In Beauty&rsquo;s throne; see now, who dares come near<br />
Those scarlet judges, threatening bloody pain!<br />
O heavenly fool, thy most kiss-worthy face<br />
Anger invests with such a lovely grace,<br />
That Anger&rsquo;s self I needs must kiss again.</p>

sole object of felicity,<br />
With wings of love in air of wonder fly,<br />

Or if I needs, sweet Judge, must torments have,<br />
Use something else to chasten me withal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than those blest eyes, where all my hopes do

&nbsp;&nbsp; No doom should make one&rsquo;s heaven become his

<h3>SLEEP</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Come</span>, Sleep! O
Sleep, the certain knot of peace,<br />

The poor man&rsquo;s wealth, the prisoner&rsquo;s release,<br />
The indifferent judge between the high and low;<br />
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease<br />
Of those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw:<br />
O make in me those civil wars to cease;<br />
I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.<br />
Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,<br />
A chamber deaf of noise and blind of light,<br />
A rosy garland and a weary head:<br />
And if these things, as being thine in right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Livelier than elsewhere Stella&rsquo;s image

<h3>WAT&rsquo;RED WAS MY WINE</h3>

<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>I joyed;
but straight thus wat&rsquo;red was my wine,<br />

Which would not let me, whom she loved, decline<br />
From nobler course, fit for my birth and mind:<br />
And therefore, by her love&rsquo;s authority,<br />
Wiled me these tempests of vain love to fly,<br />
And anchor fast myself on virtue&rsquo;s shore.<br />
Alas, if this the only metal be<br />
Of love new-coined to help my beggary,<br />
Dear, love me not, that you may love me more.</p>

<h3>FAWNIA</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, were she pitiful
as she is fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or but as mild as she is seeming so,<br />
Then were my hopes greater than my despair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then all the world were heaven, nothing woe!<br />
Ah, were her heart relenting as her hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That seems to melt even with the mildest touch,<br

Then knew I where to seat me in a land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under wide heavens, but yet I know not such.<br />
So as she shows, she seems the budding rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet sweeter far than is an earthly flower,<br />
Sovereign of beauty, like the spray she grows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Compassed she is with thorns and cankered flower;<br

Yet were she willing to be plucked and worn,<br />
She would be gathered, though she grew on thorn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, when she sings, all music else be still,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; When she is set, the gladsome day is done.<br />
O glorious sun, imagine me thy west,<br />
Shine in mine arms, and set thou in my breast!</p>

My dream thou brok&rsquo;st not but continu&rsquo;dst it:<br />
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Thou art
so true, that thoughts of thee suffice<br />
To make dreams truth, and fables histories;<br />

Not to dream all my dream, let&rsquo;s act the rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">As lightning or a taper&rsquo;s light,<br />

Profane to think thee anything but thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Coming and staying showed thee thee,<br />

If mixture it of fear, shame, honour, have.<br />
Perchance as torches, which must ready be,<br />

She, poor bird, as all forlorn,<br />
Leaned her breast up-till a thorn,<br />
And there sung the dolefull&rsquo;st ditty<br />

Fie, fie, fie, now would she cry;<br />
Teru, teru, by and by:<br />
That to hear her so complain<br />
Scarce I could from tears refrain;<br />
For her griefs so lively shown<br />
Made me think upon mine own.<br />
&mdash;Ah, thought I, thou mourn&rsquo;st in vain,<br />
None takes pity on thy pain:<br />
Senseless trees, they cannot hear thee,<br />
Ruthless beasts, they will not cheer thee;<br />
King Pandion, he is dead,<br />
All thy friends are lapped in lead:<br />
All thy fellow birds do sing<br />
Careless of thy sorrowing:<br />
Even so, poor bird, like thee<br />
None alive will pity me.</p>

Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.</p>

Do but mark, her forehead&rsquo;s smoother<br />

Than words that soothe her!<br />
And from her arched brows, such a grace<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sheds itself through the face,<br />
As alone there triumphs to the life<br />
All the gain, all the good of the elements&rsquo; strife.</p>

That others should not warm them at my fire:<br />

should shine<br />
On all men&rsquo;s fruits and flowers as well as mine.</p>
<p class="poetry">But under the disguise of love,<br />
Thou say&rsquo;st thou only cam&rsquo;st to prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What my
affections were.<br />
Think&rsquo;st thou that love is helped by fear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, get thee
quickly forth,<br />
Love&rsquo;s sickness and his noted want of worth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek doubting
men to please.<br />
I ne&rsquo;er will owe my health to a disease.</p>

Sweetest breath and clearest eye,<br />

The ant, the field-mouse, and the mole<br />
To rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm<br />

<h3>SONG</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus</span>,
arise!<br />
And paint the sable skies<br />
With azure, white, and red:<br />
Rouse Memnon&rsquo;s mother from her Tithon&rsquo;s bed<br />
That she thy c&agrave;reer may with roses spread:<br />
The nightingales thy coming each-where sing:<br />
Make an eternal Spring!<br />
Give life to this dark world which lieth dead;<br />
Spread forth thy golden hair<br />
In larger locks than thou wast wont before,<br />
And emperor-like decore<br />
With diadem of pearl thy temples fair:<br />
Chase hence the ugly night<br />
Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light.</p>
<p class="poetry">This is that happy morn,<br />
That day, long-wished day<br />
Of all my life so dark<br />
(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn<br />
And fates not hope betray),<br />
Which, purely white, deserves<br />
An everlasting diamond should it mark.<br />
This is the morn should bring unto this grove<br />
My Love, to hear and recompense my love.<br />
Fair king, who all preserves,<br />
But show thy blushing beams,<br />
And thou two sweeter eyes<br />
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Shalt see
than those which by Peneus&rsquo; streams<br />
Did once thy heart surprise.<br />
Nay, suns, which shine as clear<br />
As thou, when two thou didst to Rome appear.<br />
Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise:<br />
If that ye winds would hear<br />
A voice surpassing far Amphion&rsquo;s lyre,<br />
Your stormy chiding stay;<br />
Let Zephyr only breathe,<br />
And with her tresses play,<br />
Kissing sometimes these purple ports of death.<br />
&mdash;The winds all silent are,<br />
And Ph&oelig;bus in his chair<br />
Ensaffroning sea and air<br />
Makes vanish every star:<br />
Night like a drunkard reels<br />
Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels:<br />
The fields with flowers are decked in every hue,<br />
The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue;<br />
Here is the pleasant place&mdash;<br />
And nothing wanting is, save She, alas!</p>
<h3>SLEEP, SILENCE&rsquo; CHILD</h3>

Silence&rsquo; child, sweet father of soft rest,<br />
Prince, whose approach peace to all mortals brings,<br />
Indifferent host to shepherds and to kings,<br />
Sole comforter of minds with grief oppressed;<br />
Lo, by thy charming rod all breathing things<br />
Lie slumb&rsquo;ring, with forgetfulness possessed,<br />
And yet o&rsquo;er me to spread thy drowsy wings<br />
Thou sparest, alas! who cannot be thy guest.<br />
Since I am thine, O come, but with that face<br />
To inward light which thou art wont to show;<br />

<h3>TO THE NIGHTINGALE</h3>

from these shadows sends,<br />
Ere that the blushing morn dare show her light,<br />
Such sad lamenting strains, that night attends,<br />
Become all ear, stars stay to hear thy plight:<br />
If one whose grief even reach of thought transcends,<br />
Who ne&rsquo;er, not in a dream, did taste delight,<br />
May thee importune who like care pretends,<br />
And seems to joy in woe, in woe&rsquo;s despite;<br />
Tell me (so may thou fortune milder try,<br />
And long, long sing) for what thou thus complains,<br />
Sith, winter gone, the sun in dappled sky<br />
Now smiles on meadows, mountains, woods, and plains?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird, as if my question did her move,<br />

In Cyprus&rsquo; gardens gathering those fair flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of her blood were born,<br />
I saw, but fainting saw, my paramours.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Had left each outward part,<br />
And now did take its last leave of the heart;<br />
Nought else did want, save death, even to be dead;<br />
When the afflicted band about her bed,<br />
Seeing so fair him come in lips, cheeks, eyes,<br />
Cried, &lsquo;Ah! and can death enter paradise?&rsquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Than thine shall by Love&rsquo;s hand be bound,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And both with equal glory crowned.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then shalt thou weep, entreat, complain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Love, as I did once to thee:<br />
When all thy tears shall be as vain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As mine were then: for thou shalt be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Damned for thy false Apostacy.</p>
<h3>AN HYMENEAL DIALOGUE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><i>Groom</i>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Tell</span> me, my Love, since Hymen tied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy knot, hast thou not felt<br />
A new-infused spirit slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into thy breast, whilst mine did melt?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Bride</i>.&mdash;First tell me, Sweet, whose
words were those?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For though your voice the air did break,<br />
Yet did my soul the sense compose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through your lips my heart did speak.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span><i>Groom</i>.&mdash;Then I perceive, when from the
flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of love my scorched soul did retire,<br />
Your frozen heart in that place came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweetly melted in that fire.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Bride</i>.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis true, for when
that mutual change<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of souls was made, with equal gain,<br />
I straight might feel diffused a strange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But gentle heat through every vein.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Bride</i>.&mdash;Thy bosom then I&rsquo;ll
make my nest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there my willing soul doth perch.<br />
<i>Groom</i>.&mdash;And for my heart, in thy chaste breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make an everlasting search.</p>
<p class="poetry">O blest disunion, that doth so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our bodies from our souls divide;<br />
As two to one, and one four grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each by contraction multiplied.</p>
<h3>INGRATEFUL BEAUTY THREATENED</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Know</span>, Celia (since
thou art so proud),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas I that gave thee thy renown!<br />
Thou hadst in the forgotten crowd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of common beauties lived unknown,<br />
Had not my verse exhaled thy name,<br />
And with it imped the wings of fame.</p>
<p class="poetry">That killing power is none of thine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave it to thy voice and eyes;<br />
Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art my star, shin&rsquo;st in my skies;<br />
Then dart not from thy borrowed sphere<br />
Lightning on him that fixed thee there.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest what I made I uncreate!<br />
Let fools thy mystic forms adore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll know thee in thy mortal state.<br />
Wise poets, that wrapped the truth in tales,<br />
Knew her themselves through all her veils.</p>

Then he that patiently want&rsquo;s burden bears<br />
No burden bears, but is a king, a king!<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sweet</span>, be not proud
of those two eyes<br />
Which star-like sparkle in their skies;<br />
Nor be you proud, that you can see<br />
All hearts your captives; yours yet free.<br />
Be you not proud of that rich hair<br />
Which wantons with the love-sick air;<br />
Whenas that ruby which you wear,<br />
Sunk from the tip of your soft ear,<br />
Will last to be a precious stone<br />
When all your world of beauty&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<h3>TO MEADOWS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ye</span> have been fresh

&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose silvery feet did tread,<br />
And with dishevelled hair<br />

<h3>TO DAFFODILS</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the hasting day<br />

And, having prayed together, we<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; As your hours do, and dry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like to the Summer&rsquo;s rain,<br />
Or as the pearls of morning&rsquo;s dew,<br />

Speak grief in you,<br />

<h3>DRESS</h3>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">sweet</span> disorder in

Kindles in clothes a wantonness:&mdash;<br />
A lawn about the shoulders thrown<br />
Into a fine distraction,&mdash;<br />
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>An erring
lace, which here and there<br />
Enthrals the crimson stomacher,&mdash;<br />
A cuff neglectful, and thereby<br />
Ribbands to flow confusedly,&mdash;<br />
A winning wave, deserving note,<br />
In the tempestuous petticoat,&mdash;<br />
A careless shoe-string, in whose tie<br />
I see a wild civility,&mdash;<br />
Do more bewitch me, than when art<br />
Is too precise in every part.</p>
<h3>IN SILKS</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh-quilted colours through the
air!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get up, sweet Slug-a-bed, and
see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dew bespangling herb and
tree.<br />
Each flower has wept, and bowed toward the east,<br />
Above an hour since; yet you not drest&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay! not so much as out of bed,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the birds have matins
said,<br />

Spring, sooner than the lark, to fetch in May.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For jewels for your gown or
hair:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear not; the leaves will strew<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gems in abundance upon you:<br />
Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,<br />
Against you come, some orient pearls unwept:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, and receive them while the
light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangs on the dew-locks of the
night:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Titan on the eastern hill<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retires himself, or else stands
still<br />
Till you come forth.&nbsp; Wash, dress, be brief in praying:<br

Few beads are best, when once we go a-Maying.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come, my Corinna, come! and coming, mark<br />
How each field turns a street, each street a park<br />

bough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or branch: each porch, each door,
ere this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ark, a tabernacle is,<br />
Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove,<br />
As if here were those cooler shades of love.<br />

street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And open fields, and we not
see&rsquo;t?<br />

come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back, and with white-thorn laden
home.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have despatched their cakes
and cream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before that we have left to
dream:<br />
And some have wept, and wooed, and plighted troth<br />
And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a green-gown has been
given;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a kiss, both odd and even:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a glance, too, has been
sent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the eye, Love&rsquo;s
firmament:<br />
Many a jest told of the keys betraying<br />
This night, and locks picked:&mdash;Yet we&rsquo;re not
a-Maying.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come! let us go, while we are in our prime,<br
/>
And take the harmless folly of the time!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall grow old apace, and
die<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we know our liberty.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our life is short; and our days
run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast away as does the sun:<br
/>
And as a vapour, or a drop of rain<br />
Once lost, can ne&rsquo;er be found again;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when or you or I are made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fable, song, or fleeting
shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All love, all liking, all
delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies drowned with us in endless
night.<br />
Then while time serves, and we are but decaying,<br />
Come, my Corinna, come! let&rsquo;s go a-Maying.</p>

and tender to offend:<br />
In friendship, first I think if that agree<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which I intend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto my friend&rsquo;s intent and end;<br />
I would not use a friend as I use Thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">If any touch my friend or his good name,<br />
It is my honour and my love-to free<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His blasted fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the least spot or thought of blame;<br />
I could not use a friend as I use Thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">My friend may spit upon my curious floor;<br />
Would he have gold?&nbsp; I lend it instantly;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But let the poor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Thee within them, starve at door;<br />
I cannot use a friend as I use Thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">When that my friend pretendeth to a place,<br
/>
I quit my interest, and leave it free;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when Thy grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sues for my heart, I Thee displace;<br />
Nor would I use a friend as I use Thee.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Yet can a friend what Thou hast done fulfil?<br />
O, write in brass, &lsquo;My God upon a tree<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His blood did spill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only to purchase my good-will&rsquo;;<br />
Yet use I not my foes as I use Thee.</p>
<h3>LOVE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Love</span> bade me
welcome; yet my soul drew back,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guilty of dust and sin.<br />
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From my first entrance in,<br />
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If I lacked anything.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;A guest,&rsquo; I answered,
&lsquo;worthy to be here&rsquo;:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love said, &lsquo;You shall be he.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;I, the unkind, ungrateful?&nbsp; Ah, my dear!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I cannot look on thee.&rsquo;<br />
Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who made the eyes but I?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Truth, Lord; but I have marred them; let
my shame<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Go where it doth deserve.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;And know you not,&rsquo; says Love, &lsquo;who bore the
blame?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;My dear, then I will serve.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;You must sit down,&rsquo; says Love, &lsquo;and taste my
meat.&rsquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I did sit and eat.</p>
<h3>THE PULLEY</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">When</span> God at first made man,<br />
Having a glass of blessings standing by,<br />
&lsquo;Let us,&rsquo; said He, &lsquo;pour on him all we can;<br
/>
Let the world&rsquo;s riches, which dispersed lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract into a span.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>So strength
first made a way,<br />
Then beauty flowed, then wisdom, honour pleasure;<br />
When almost all was out, God made a stay,<br />
Perceiving that, alone of all His treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest in the bottom lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For
if I should,&rsquo; said He,<br />
&lsquo;Bestow this jewel also on My creature,<br />
He would adore My gifts instead of Me,<br />
And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So both should losers be.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yet
let him keep the rest,<br />
But keep them with repining restlessness;<br />
Let him be rich and weary, that at least,<br />
If goodness lead him not, yet weariness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May toss him to My
breast.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>THE COLLAR</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">struck</span> the board,
and cried, &lsquo;No more;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will
abroad.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What, shall I ever sigh and pine?<br />
My lines and life are free; free as the road,<br />
Loose as the wind, as large as store.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall I be still
in suit?<br />
Have I no harvest but a thorn<br />
To let me blood, and not restore<br />
What I have lost with cordial fruit?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure there was
wine<br />
Before my sighs did dry it; there was corn<br />
Before my tears did drown it;<br />
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Is the
year only lost to me?<br />
Have I no bays to crown it,<br />
No flowers, no garlands gay? all blasted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All wasted?<br
/>
Not so, my heart; but there is fruit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou hast
hands.<br />
Recover all thy sigh-blown age<br />
On double pleasures; leave thy cold dispute<br />
Of what is fit and not; forsake thy cage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy rope of
sands,<br />
Which petty thoughts have made; and made to thee<br />
Good cable, to enforce and draw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be thy
law,<br />
While thou didst wink and wouldst not see.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away! take
heed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will
abroad.<br />
Call in thy death&rsquo;s-head there, tie-up thy fears;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He that
forbears<br />
To suit and serve his need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deserves his
load.&rsquo;<br />
But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At every
word,<br />
Methought I heard one calling, &lsquo;Child&rsquo;;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I replied,
&lsquo;My Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>LIFE</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">made</span> a posy while
the day ran by:<br />
Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My life within this band;<br />
But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they<br />
By noon most cunningly did steal away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And withered in my hand.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>My hand was next to them, and then my heart;<br />
I took, without more thinking, in good part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s gentle admonition;<br />
Who did so sweetly Death&rsquo;s sad taste convey,<br />
Making my mind to smell my fatal day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet sugaring the suspicion.</p>
<p class="poetry">Farewell, dear flowers; sweetly your time ye
spent,<br />
Fit while ye lived for smell or ornament,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And after death for cures.<br />
I follow straight, without complaints or grief,<br />
Since if my scent be good, I care not if<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It be as short as yours.</p>
<h3>MISERY</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Lord</span>, let the angels
praise Thy name:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man is a foolish thing, a foolish thing;<br />
Folly and sin play all his game;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His house still burns, and yet he still doth
sing&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Man is but grass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows
it&mdash;&lsquo;Fill the glass.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">How canst Thou brook his foolishness?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;ll not lose a cup of drink for
Thee:<br />
Bid him but temper his excess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not he: he knows where he can better be&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he will swear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to serve
Thee in fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">What strange pollutions doth he wed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make his own! as if none knew but he.<br />
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>No man
shall beat into his head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Thou within his curtains drawn canst see:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;They are of cloth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where never yet
came moth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The best of men, turn but Thy hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For one poor minute, stumble at a pin;<br />
They would not have their actions scanned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor any sorrow tell them that they sin,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though it be small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And measure not
the fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">They quarrel Thee, and would give over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bargain made to serve Thee; but Thy love<br />
Holds them unto it, and doth cover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their follies with the wings of Thy mild Dove,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not suffering those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would, to be
Thy foes.</p>
<p class="poetry">My God, man cannot praise Thy name:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art all brightness, perfect purity;<br />
The sun holds down his head for shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead with eclipses, when we speak of Thee:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How shall infection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presume on Thy
perfection?</p>
<p class="poetry">As dirty hands foul all they touch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And those things most which are most pure and
fine,<br />
So our clay-hearts, even when we crouch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sing Thy praises, make them less divine:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet either this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or none Thy
portion is.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And serve the swine&mdash;there, that is his

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;There let them shine;<br />

sleep or dine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The bird that sees a dainty bower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made in the tree, where she was wont to sit,<br />
Wonders and sings, but not His power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who made the arbour; this exceeds her wit.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But man doth know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spring
whence all things flow:</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet, as though he knew it not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His knowledge winks, and lets his humours reign;<br

They make his life a constant blot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the blood of God to run in vain.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ah, wretch! what verse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can thy strange
ways rehearse?</p>
<p class="poetry">Indeed, at first man was a treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A box of jewels, shop of rarities,<br />
A ring whose posy was &lsquo;my pleasure&rsquo;;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a garden in a Paradise;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Glory and grace<br />

Find out some uncouth cell<br />

And the night-raven sings;<br />

As ragged as thy locks,<br />

Jest, and youthful jollity,<br />
Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles,<br />
Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles,<br />
Such as hang on Hebe&rsquo;s cheek,<br />
And love to live in dimple sleek;<br />
Sport that wrinkled Care derides,<br />
And Laughter holding both his sides:&mdash;<br />
Come, and trip it as you go<br />
On the light fantastic toe;<br />
And in thy right hand lead with thee<br />
The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty;<br />
And if I give thee honour due,<br />
Mirth, admit me of thy crew,<br />
To live with her, and live with thee<br />
In unreproved pleasures free;<br />
To hear the lark begin his flight<br />
And singing startle the dull night<br />
From his watch-tower in the skies,<br />
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;<br />
Then to come, in spite of sorrow,<br />
And at my window bid good-morrow<br />
Through the sweetbriar, or the vine,<br />
Or the twisted eglantine:<br />
While the cock with lively din<br />
Scatters the rear of darkness thin,<br />
And to the stack, or the barn-door,<br />
Stoutly struts his dames before:<br />
Oft listening how the hounds and horn<br />
Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn,<br />
From the side of some hoar hill,<br />
Through the high wood echoing shrill:<br />
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Sometime
walking, not unseen,<br />
By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,<br />
Right against the eastern gate<br />
Where the great Sun begins his state<br />
Robed in flames and amber light,<br />
The clouds in thousand liveries dight;<br />
While the ploughman, near at hand,<br />
Whistles o&rsquo;er the furrowed land,<br />
And the milkmaid singeth blithe,<br />
And the mower whets his scythe,<br />
And every shepherd tells his tale<br />
Under the hawthorn in the dale.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures<br />
Whilst the landscape round it measures;<br />
Russet lawns, and fallows gray,<br />
Where the nibbling flocks do stray;<br />
Mountains, on whose barren breast<br />
The labouring clouds do often rest;<br />
Meadows trim with daisies pied,<br />
Shallow brooks, and rivers wide;<br />
Towers and battlements it sees<br />
Bosomed high in tufted trees,<br />
Where perhaps some Beauty lies,<br />
The cynosure of neighbouring eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes<br />
From betwixt two aged oaks,<br />
Where Corydon and Thyrsis, met,<br />
Are at their savoury dinner set<br />
Of herbs, and other country messes,<br />
Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;<br />
And then in haste her bower she leaves,<br />
With Thestylis to bind the sheaves;<br />
Or, if the earlier season lead,<br />
To the tanned haycock in the mead.<br />

The upland hamlets will invite,<br />
When the merry bells ring round,<br />
And the jocund rebecks sound<br />
To many a youth and many a maid,<br />
Dancing in the chequered shade;<br />
And young and old come forth to play<br />
On a sunshine holiday,<br />
Till the live-long day-light fail:<br />
Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,<br />
With stories told of many a feat,<br />
How Faery Mab the junkets eat:&mdash;<br />
She was pinched and pulled, she said;<br />
And he by Friar&rsquo;s lantern led;<br />
Tells how the grudging Goblin sweat<br />
To earn his cream-bowl duly set,<br />
When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,<br />
His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn<br />
That ten day-labourers could not end;<br />
Then lies him down the lubber fiend,<br />
And, stretched out all the chimney&rsquo;s length,<br />
Basks at the fire his hairy strength;<br />
And crop-full out of doors he flings,<br />
Ere the first cock his matin rings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,<br />
By whispering winds soon lulled asleep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Towered cities please us then<br />
And the busy hum of men,<br />
Where throngs of knights and barons bold,<br />
In weeds of peace, high triumphs hold,<br />
With store of ladies, whose bright eyes<br />
Rain influence, and judge the prize<br />
Of wit or arms, while both contend<br />
To win her grace, whom all commend.<br />
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>There
let Hymen oft appear<br />
In saffron robe, with taper clear,<br />
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,<br />
With mask, and antique pageantry;<br />
Such sights as youthful poets dream<br />
On summer eves by haunted stream.<br />
Then to the well-trod stage anon,<br />
If Jonson&rsquo;s learned sock be on,<br />
Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy&rsquo;s child,<br />
Warble his native wood-notes wild.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ever against eating cares<br />
Lap me in soft Lydian airs<br />
Married to immortal verse,<br />
Such as the meeting soul may pierce<br />
In notes, with many a winding bout<br />
Of linked sweetness long drawn out,<br />
With wanton heed and giddy cunning,<br />
The melting voice through mazes running,<br />
Untwisting all the chains that tie<br />
The hidden soul of harmony;<br />
That Orpheus&rsquo; self may heave his head<br />
From golden slumber, on a bed<br />
Of heaped Elysian flowers, and hear<br />
Such strains as would have won the ear<br />
Of Pluto, to have quite set free<br />
His half-regained Eurydice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These delights if thou canst give,<br />
Mirth, with thee I mean to live.</p>

Riding near her highest noon,<br />

Through the heaven&rsquo;s wide pathless way,<br />
And oft, as if her head she bowed,<br />
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.<br />

I hear the far-off curfew sound<br />
Over some wide-watered shore,<br />
Swinging slow with sullen roar;<br />
Or, if the air will not permit,<br />
Some still, removed place will fit,<br />
Where glowing embers through the room<br />
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom;<br />
Far from all resort of mirth,<br />
Save the cricket on the hearth,<br />
Or the bellman&rsquo;s drowsy charm<br />
To bless the doors from nightly harm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or let my lamp at midnight hour<br />
Be seen in some high lonely tower,<br />
Where I may oft out-watch the Bear<br />
With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere<br />

What worlds or what vast regions hold<br />
The immortal mind, that hath forsook<br />
Her mansion in this fleshly nook:<br />
And of those demons that are found<br />
In fire, air, flood, or under ground,<br />
Whose power hath a true consent<br />
With planet, or with element.<br />

Not tricked and frounced as she was wont<br />
With the Attic Boy to hunt,<br />
But kercheft in a comely cloud<br />
While rocking winds are piping loud,<br />
Or ushered with a shower still,<br />
When the gust hath blown his fill,<br />
Ending on the rustling leaves<br />
With minute drops from off the eaves.<br />
And when the sun begins to fling<br />
His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring<br />
To arched walks of twilight groves,<br />
And shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,<br />
Of pine, or monumental oak,<br />

never heard the nymphs to daunt,<br />
Or fright them from their hallowed haunt.<br />
There in close covert by some brook,<br />
Where no profaner eye may look,<br />
Hide me from day&rsquo;s garish eye,<br />
While the bee with honeyed thigh,<br />
That at her flowery work doth sing,<br />
And the waters murmuring,<br />
With such consort as they keep<br />
Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep;<br />
And let some strange mysterious dream<br />
Wave at his wings in airy stream<br />
Of lively portraiture displayed,<br />
Softly on my eyelids laid:<br />
And, as I wake, sweet music breathe<br />
Above, about, or underneath,<br />
Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,<br />
Or the unseen Genius of the wood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But let my due feet never fail<br />
To walk the studious cloister&rsquo;s pale,<br />
And love the high-embowed roof,<br />
With antique pillars massy proof,<br />
And storied windows richly dight<br />
Casting a dim religious light.<br />
There let the pealing organ blow<br />
To the full-voiced quire below<br />
In service high and anthems clear,<br />
As may with sweetness, through mine ear,<br />
Dissolve me into ecstasies,<br />
And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And may at last my weary age<br />
Find out the peaceful hermitage,<br />
The hairy gown and mossy cell<br />
Where I may sit and rightly spell<br />
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Of every
star that heaven doth shew,<br />
And every herb that sips the dew;<br />
Till old experience do attain<br />
To something like prophetic strain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These pleasures, Melancholy, give,<br />
And I with thee will choose to live.</p>
<h3>LYCIDAS</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Elegy on a Friend drowned in the
Irish Channel</i>, 1637</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Yet</span> once more, O ye
laurels, and once more<br />
Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,<br />
I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,<br />
And with forced fingers rude<br />
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.<br />
Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear<br />
Compels me to disturb your season due:<br />
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,<br />
Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.<br />
Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew<br />
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.<br />
He must not float upon his watery bier<br />
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,<br />
Without the meed of some melodious tear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin, then, Sisters of the
sacred well<br />
That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;<br />
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string.<br />
Hence withdenial vain and coy excuse:<br />
So may some gentle Muse<br />
With lucky words favour my destined urn;<br />
And, as he passes, turn<br />
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>For we were nursed upon the
self-same hill,<br />
Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill:<br />
Together both, ere the high lawns appeared<br />
Under the opening eyelids of the Morn,<br />
We drove a-field, and both together heard<br />
What time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn,<br />
Battening our nocks with the fresh dews of night,<br />
Oft till the star that rose at evening bright<br />
Toward heaven&rsquo;s descent had sloped his westering wheel.<br
/>
Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,<br />
Tempered to the oaten flute,<br />
Rough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel<br />
From the glad sound would not be absent long;<br />
And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, oh! the heavy change,
now thou art gone,<br />
Now thou art gone and never must return!<br />
Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves<br />
With wild thyme and the gadding vine o&rsquo;ergrown,<br />
And all their echoes, mourn:<br />
The willows and the hazel copses green<br />
Shall now no more be seen<br />
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.<br />
As killing as the canker to the rose,<br />
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,<br />
Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear<br />
When first the white-thorn blows;<br />
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were ye, Nymphs, when
the remorseless deep<br />
Closed o&rsquo;er the head of your loved Lycidas?<br />
For neither were ye playing on the steep<br />
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Where
your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,<br />
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,<br />
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:<br />
Ay me!&nbsp; I fondly dream&mdash;<br />
Had ye been there . . .&nbsp; For what could that have done?<br
/>
What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,<br />
The Muse herself, for her enchanting son,<br />
Whom universal nature did lament,<br />
When by the rout that made the hideous roar<br />
His gory visage down the stream was sent,<br />
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! what boots it with
incessant care<br />
To tend the homely, slighted, shepherd&rsquo;s trade,<br />
And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?<br />
Were it not better done, as others use,<br />
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,<br />
Or with the tangles of Neaera&rsquo;s hair?<br />
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise<br />
(That last infirmity of noble mind)<br />
To scorn delights, and live laborious days;<br />
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,<br />
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,<br />
Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears,<br />
And slits the thin-spun life.&nbsp; &lsquo;But not the
praise,&rsquo;<br />
Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears;<br />
&lsquo;Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,<br />
Nor in the glistering foil<br />
Set off to the world, nor in broad rumour lies:<br />
But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes<br />
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;<br />
As he pronounces lastly on each deed,<br />
Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>O fountain Arethuse, and thou
honoured flood,<br />
Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,<br />
That strain I heard was of a higher mood.<br />
But now my oat proceeds,<br />
And listens to the herald of the sea<br />
That came in Neptune&rsquo;s plea.<br />
He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,<br />
What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?<br />
And questioned every gust of rugged wings<br />
That blows from off each beaked promontory.<br />
They knew not of his story;<br />
And sage Hippotades their answer brings,<br />
That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed;<br />
The air was calm, and on the level brine<br />
Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.<br />
It was that fatal and perfidious bark<br />
Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,<br />
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Camus, reverend sire,
went footing slow,<br />
His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge<br />
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge<br />
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.<br />
&lsquo;Ah! who hath reft,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;my dearest
pledge?&rsquo;<br />
Last came, and last did go<br />
The Pilot of the Galilean lake;<br />
Two massy keys he bore of metals twain<br />
(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain);<br />
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:<br />
&lsquo;How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,<br />
Enow of such, as for their bellies&rsquo; sake<br />
Creep and intrude and climb into the fold!<br />
Of other care they little reckoning make<br />
Than how to scramble at the shearers&rsquo; feast,<br />
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>And
shove away the worthy bidden guest.<br />
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold<br />
A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least<br />
That to the faithful herdman&rsquo;s art belongs!<br />
What recks it them?&nbsp; What need they?&nbsp; They are sped;<br
/>
And when they list, their lean and flashy songs<br />
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;<br />
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,<br />
But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,<br />
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:<br />
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw<br />
Daily devours apace, and nothing said:<br />
But that two-handed engine at the door<br />
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return, Alpheus; the dread
voice is past<br />
That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse,<br />
And call the vales, and bid them hither cast<br />
Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.<br />
Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use<br />
Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks<br />
On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks;<br />
Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes<br />
That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers<br />
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.<br />
Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,<br />
The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,<br />
The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,<br />
The glowing violet,<br />
The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,<br />
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,<br />
And every flower that sad embroidery wears:<br />
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Bid
amaranthus all his beauty shed,<br />
And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,<br />
To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.<br />
For so to interpose a little ease,<br />
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise:&mdash;<br />
Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas<br />
Wash far away, where&rsquo;er thy bones are hurled,<br />
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,<br />
Where thou perhaps, under the whelming tide,<br />
Visitest the bottom of the monstrous world;<br />
Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,<br />
Sleep&rsquo;st by the fable of Bellerus old,<br />
Where the great Vision of the guarded mount<br />
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona&rsquo;s hold;<br />
Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:<br />
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep no more, woeful
shepherds, weep no more,<br />
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,<br />
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor:<br />
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,<br />
And yet anon repairs his drooping head<br />
And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore<br />
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:<br />
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high<br />
Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves;<br />
Where, other groves and other streams along,<br />
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,<br />
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song<br />
In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.<br />
There entertain him all the Saints above,<br />
In solemn troops, and sweet societies,<br />
That sing, and singing in their glory move,<br />
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.<br />
<a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Now,
Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;<br />
Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore,<br />
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good<br />
To all that wander in that perilous flood.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sang the uncouth swain
to the oaks and rills,<br />
While the still morn went out with sandals grey;<br />
He touched the tender stops of various quills,<br />
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:<br />
And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,<br />
And now was dropt into the western bay:<br />
At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue:<br />
To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.</p>
<h3>ON HIS BLINDNESS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> I consider how
my light is spent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that one talent which is death to hide<br />
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent<br />
To serve therewith my Maker, and present<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My true account, lest He returning chide,&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?<br />
I fondly ask:&mdash;But Patience, to prevent<br />
That murmur, soon replies: God doth not need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Either man&rsquo;s work, or His own gifts; who
best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him
best: His state<br />
Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And post o&rsquo;er land and ocean without rest:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also serve who only stand and
wait.</p>

Rescued from death by force, though pale and faint.<br />
Mine, as whom washed from spot of child-bed taint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Purification in the Old Law did save,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And such as yet once more I trust to have<br />
Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,<br />
Came vested all in white, pure as her mind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face was veiled, yet to my fancied sight<br />
Love, sweetness, goodness in her person shined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So clear as in no face with more delight.<br />
But oh! as to embrace me she inclined,<br />

Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,<br />
What need&rsquo;st thou such weak witness of thy name?<br />
Thou in our wonder and astonishment<br />
Hast built thyself a live-long monument.<br />
For whilst, to shame of slow-endeavouring art<br />
Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart<br />
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book<br />
Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,<br />
Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,<br />
Dost make us marble with too much conceiving;<br />
And so sepulchered in such pomp dost lie,<br />
That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.</p>

Sleeking her soft alluring locks;<br />

Rise, rise, and heave thy rosy head<br />

I can fly or I can run<br />
Quickly to the green earth&rsquo;s end,<br />
Where the bowed welkin slow doth bend,<br />

Mortals that would follow me,<br />
Love Virtue; she alone is free,<br />
She can teach ye how to climb<br />
Higher than the sphery chime;<br />
Or if feeble Virtue were,<br />
Heaven itself would stoop to her.</p>

<h3>TO THE MORNING</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Satisfaction for Sleep</i></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> succour can I
hope the Muse will send,<br />
Whose drowsiness hath wronged the Muse&rsquo;s friend?<br />
What hope, Aurora, to propitiate thee,<br />
Unless the Muse sing my apology?<br />
O! in that morning of my shame, when I<br />
Lay folded up in sleep&rsquo;s captivity;<br />
How at the sight didst thou draw back thine eyes,<br />
Into thy modest veil! how didst thou rise<br />
Twice dyed in thine own blushes, and didst run<br />
To draw the curtains and awake the sun!<br />
Who, rousing his illustrious tresses, came,<br />
And seeing the loathed object, hid for shame<br />
His head in thy fair bosom, and still hides<br />
Me from his patronage; I pray, he chides;<br />
And, pointing to dull Morpheus, bids me take<br />
My own Apollo, try if I can make<br />
His Lethe be my Helicon, and see<br />
If Morpheus have a Muse to wait on me.<br />
Hence &rsquo;tis my humble fancy finds no wings,<br />
No nimble raptures, starts to heaven and brings<br />
Enthusiastic flames, such as can give<br />
Marrow to my plump genius, make it live<br />
Dressed in the glorious madness of a muse,<br />
Whose feet can walk the milky-way, and choose<br />
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Her
starry throne; whose holy heats can warm<br />
The grave, and hold up an exalted arm<br />
To lift me from my lazy urn, and climb<br />
Upon the stooped shoulders of old Time,<br />
And trace eternity.&nbsp; But all is dead,<br />
All these delicious hopes are buried<br />
In the deep wrinkles of his angry brow,<br />
Where mercy cannot find them; but, O thou<br />
Bright lady of the morn, pity doth lie<br />
So warm in thy soft breast, it cannot die;<br />
Have mercy, then, and when he next doth rise,<br />
O, meet the angry god, invade his eyes,<br />
And stroke his radiant cheeks; one timely kiss<br />
Will kill his anger, and revive my bliss.<br />
So to the treasure of thy pearly dew<br />
Thrice will I pay three tears, to show how true<br />
My grief is; so my wakeful lay shall knock<br />
At the oriental gates, and duly mock<br />
The early lark&rsquo;s shrill orisons to be<br />
An anthem at the day&rsquo;s nativity.<br />
And the same rosy-fingered hand of thine,<br />
That shuts night&rsquo;s dying eyes, shall open mine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou, faint god of sleep, forget that I<br />
Was ever known to be thy votary.<br />
No more my pillow shall thine altar be,<br />
Nor will I offer any more to thee<br />
Myself a melting sacrifice; I&rsquo;m born<br />
Again a fresh child of the buxom morn,<br />
Heir of the sun&rsquo;s first beams; why threat&rsquo;st thou
so?<br />
Why dost thou shake thy leaden sceptre?&nbsp; Go,<br />
Bestow thy poppy upon wakeful woe,<br />
Sickness and sorrow, whose pale lids ne&rsquo;er know<br />
Thy downy finger dwell upon their eyes;<br />
Shut in their tears, shut out their miseries.</p>

137</span>LOVE&rsquo;S HOROSCOPE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Love</span>, brave
Virtue&rsquo;s younger brother,<br />
Erst hath made my heart a mother.<br />
She consults the anxious spheres,<br />
To calculate her young son&rsquo;s years;<br />
She asks if sad or saving powers<br />
Gave omen to his infant hours;<br />
She asks each star that then stood by<br />
If poor Love shall live or die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, my heart, is that the way?<br />
Are these the beams that rule thy day?<br />
Thou know&rsquo;st a face in whose each look<br />
Beauty lays ope Love&rsquo;s fortune-book,<br />
On whose fair revolutions wait<br />
The obsequious motions of Love&rsquo;s fate.<br />
Ah, my heart! her eyes and she<br />
Have taught thee new astrology.<br />
Howe&rsquo;er Love&rsquo;s native hours were set,<br />
Whatever starry synod met,<br />
&rsquo;Tis in the mercy of her eye,<br />
If poor Love shall live or die.</p>
<p class="poetry">If those sharp rays, putting on<br />
Points of death, bid Love be gone;<br />
Though the heavens in council sat<br />
To crown an uncontrolled fate;<br />
Though their best aspects twined upon<br />
The kindest constellation,<br />
Cast amorous glances on his birth,<br />
And whispered the confederate earth<br />
<a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>To pave
his paths with all the good<br />
That warms the bed of youth and blood:&mdash;<br />
Love has no plea against her eye;<br />
Beauty frowns, and Love must die.</p>
<p class="poetry">But if her milder influence move,<br />
And gild the hopes of humble Love;&mdash;<br />
Though heaven&rsquo;s inauspicious eye<br />
Lay black on Love&rsquo;s nativity;<br />
Though every diamond in Jove&rsquo;s crown<br />
Fixed his forehead to a frown;&mdash;<br />
Her eye a strong appeal can give,<br />
Beauty smiles, and Love shall live.</p>
<p class="poetry">O, if Love shall live, O where,<br />
But in her eye, or in her ear,<br />
In her breast, or in her breath,<br />
Shall I hide poor Love from death?<br />
For in the life aught else can give,<br />
Love shall die, although he live.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or, if Love shall die, O where,<br />
But in her eye, or in her ear,<br />
In her breath, or in her breast,<br />
Shall I build his funeral nest?<br />
While Love shall thus entombed lie,<br />
Love shall live, although he die!</p>

149</span>MUSIC&rsquo;S DUEL</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span> westward Sol had
spent the richest beams<br />
Of noon&rsquo;s high glory, when, hard by the streams<br />
Of Tiber, on the scene of a green plat,<br />
Under protection of an oak, there sat<br />
A sweet lute&rsquo;s master: in whose gentle airs<br />
He lost the day&rsquo;s heat, and his own hot cares.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close in the covert of the leaves there stood<br />
A nightingale, come from the neighbouring wood:&mdash;<br />
The sweet inhabitant of each glad tree,<br />
Their muse, their Syren, harmless Syren she,&mdash;<br />
There stood she list&rsquo;ning, and did entertain<br />
The music&rsquo;s soft report, and mould the same<br />
In her own murmurs, that whatever mood<br />
His curious fingers lent, her voice made good.<br />
The man perceived his rival, and her art;<br />
Disposed to give the light-foot lady sport,<br />
Awakes his lute, and &rsquo;gainst the fight to come<br />
Informs it, in a sweet <i>pr&aelig;ludium</i><br />
Of closer strains; and ere the war begin<br />
He slightly skirmishes on every string,<br />
Charged with a flying touch; and straightway she<br />
Carves out her dainty voice as readily<br />
Into a thousand sweet distinguished tones;<br />
And reckons up in soft divisions<br />
Quick volumes of wild notes, to let him know<br />
By that shrill taste she could do something too.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His nimble hand&rsquo;s instinct then taught each
string<br />
A cap&rsquo;ring cheerfulness; and made them sing<br />
To their own dance; now negligently rash<br />
He throws his arm, and with a long-drawn dash<br />
Blends all together, then distinctly trips<br />
From this to that, then, quick returning, skips<br />
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>And
snatches this again, and pauses there.<br />
She measures every measure, everywhere<br />
Meets art with art; sometimes, as if in doubt&mdash;<br />
Not perfect yet, and fearing to be out&mdash;<br />
Trails her plain ditty in one long-spun note<br />
Through the sleek passage of her open throat:<br />
A clear unwrinkled song; then doth she point it<br />
With tender accents, and severely joint it<br />
By short diminutives, that, being reared<br />
In controverting warbles evenly shared,<br />
With her sweet sell she wrangles; he, amazed<br />
That from so small a channel should be raised<br />
The torrent of a voice whose melody<br />
Could melt into such sweet variety,<br />
Strains higher yet, that, tickled with rare art,<br />
The tattling strings&mdash;each breathing in his part&mdash;<br
/>
Most kindly do fall out; the grumbling bass<br />
In surly groans disdains the treble&rsquo;s grace;<br />
The high-perched treble chirps at this, and chides<br />
Until his finger&mdash;moderator&mdash;hides<br />
And closes the sweet quarrel, rousing all,<br />
Hoarse, shrill, at once: as when the trumpets call<br />
Hot Mars to th&rsquo; harvest of death&rsquo;s field, and woo<br
/>
Men&rsquo;s hearts into their hands; this lesson, too,<br />
She gives him back, her supple breast thrills out<br />
Sharp airs, and staggers in a warbling doubt<br />
Of dallying sweetness, hovers o&rsquo;er her skill,<br />
And folds in waved notes, with a trembling bill,<br />
The pliant series of her slippery song;<br />
Then starts she suddenly into a throng<br />
Of short thick sobs, whose thund&rsquo;ring volleys float<br />
And roll themselves over her lubric throat<br />
In panting murmurs, &rsquo;stilled out of her breast,<br />
That ever-bubbling spring, the sugared nest<br />
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Of her
delicious soul, that there does lie<br />
Bathing in streams of liquid melody,&mdash;<br />
Music&rsquo;s best seed-plot; when in ripened ears<br />
A golden-headed harvest fairly rears<br />
His honey-dropping tops, ploughed by her breath,<br />
Which there reciprocally laboureth.<br />
In that sweet soil it seems a holy quire<br />
Founded to th&rsquo; name of great Apollo&rsquo;s lyre;<br />
Whose silver roof rings with the sprightly notes<br />
Of sweet-lipped angel-imps, that swill their throats<br />
In cream of morning Helicon; and then<br />
Prefer soft anthems to the ears of men,<br />
To woo them from their beds, still murmuring<br />
That men can sleep while they their matins sing;&mdash;<br />
Most divine service! whose so early lay<br />
Prevents the eyelids of the blushing day.<br />
There might you hear her kindle her soft voice<br />
In the close murmur of a sparkling noise,<br />
And lay the ground-work of her hopeful song;<br />
Still keeping in the forward stream so long,<br />
Till a sweet whirlwind, striving to get out,<br />
Heaves her soft bosom, wanders round about,<br />
And makes a pretty earthquake in her breast;<br />
Till the fledged notes at length forsake their nest,<br />
Fluttering in wanton shoals, and to the sky,<br />
Winged with their own wild echos, pratt&rsquo;ling fly.<br />
She opes the floodgate, and lets loose a tide<br />
Of streaming sweetness, which in state doth ride<br />
On the waved back of every swelling strain,<br />
Rising and falling in a pompous train;<br />
And while she thus discharges a shrill peal<br />
Of flashing airs, she qualifies their zeal<br />
With the cool epode of a graver note;<br />
Thus high, thus low, as if her silver throat<br />
<a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Would
reach the brazen voice of war&rsquo;s hoarse bird;<br />
Her little soul is ravished; and so poured<br />
Into loose ecstasies, that she is placed<br />
Above herself&mdash;music&rsquo;s enthusiast!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame now and anger mixed a double stain<br />
In the musician&rsquo;s face: Yet once again,<br />
Mistress, I come.&nbsp; Now reach a strain, my lute,<br />
Above her mock, or be for ever mute;<br />
Or tune a song of victory to me,<br />
Or to thyself sing thine own obsequy!<br />
So said, his hands sprightly as fire he flings,<br />
And with a quivering coyness tastes the strings:<br />
The sweet-lipped sisters, musically frighted,<br />
Singing their fears, are fearfully delighted:<br />
Trembling as when Apollo&rsquo;s golden hairs<br />
Are fanned and frizzled in the wanton airs<br />
Of his own breath, which, married to his lyre,<br />
Doth tune the spheres, and make heaven&rsquo;s self look
higher;<br />
From this to that, from that to this, he flies,<br />
Feels music&rsquo;s pulse in all her arteries;<br />
Caught in a net which there Apollo spreads,<br />
His fingers struggle with the vocal threads,<br />
Following those little rills, he sinks into<br />
A sea of Helicon; his hand does go<br />
Those parts of sweetness which with nectar drop,<br />
Softer than that which pants in Hebe&rsquo;s cup:<br />
The humorous strings expound his learned touch<br />
By various glosses; now they seem to grutch<br />
And murmur in a buzzing din, then gingle<br />
In shrill-tongued accents, striving to be single;<br />
Every smooth turn, every delicious stroke,<br />
Gives life to some new grace: thus doth he invoke<br />
Sweetness by all her names; thus, bravely thus&mdash;<br />
Fraught with a fury so harmonious&mdash;<br />
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The
lute&rsquo;s light Genius now does proudly rise,<br />
Heaved on the surges of swoll&rsquo;n rhapsodies,<br />
Whose flourish, meteor-like, doth curl the air<br />
With flash of high-born fancies; here and there<br />
Dancing in lofty measures, and anon<br />
Creeps on the soft touch of a tender tone,<br />
Whose trembling murmurs, melting in wild airs,<br />
Run to and fro, complaining his sweet cares;<br />
Because those precious mysteries that dwell<br />
In music&rsquo;s ravished soul he dare not tell,<br />
But whisper to the world: thus do they vary,<br />
Each string his note, as if they meant to carry<br />
Their master&rsquo;s blest soul, snatched out at his ears<br />
By a strong ecstasy, through all the spheres<br />
Of music&rsquo;s heaven; and seat it there on high<br />
In th&rsquo; <i>empyr&aelig;um</i> of pure harmony.<br />
At length&mdash;after so long, so loud a strife<br />
Of all the strings, still breathing the best life<br />
Of blest variety, attending on<br />
His fingers&rsquo; fairest revolution,<br />
In many a sweet rise, many as sweet a fall&mdash;<br />
A full-mouthed diapason swallows all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This done, he lists what she would say to this;<br
/>
And she, although her breath&rsquo;s late exercise<br />
Had dealt too roughly with her tender throat,<br />
Yet summons all her sweet powers for a note.<br />
Alas, in vain! for while, sweet soul, she tries<br />
To measure all those wild diversities<br />
Of chatt&rsquo;ring strings, by the small size of one<br />
Poor simple voice, raised in a natural tone,<br />
She fails; and failing, grieves; and grieving, dies;<br />
She dies, and leaves her life the victor&rsquo;s prize,<br />
Falling upon his lute.&nbsp; O, fit to have&mdash;<br />
That lived so sweetly&mdash;dead, so sweet a grave!</p>

readers! you that come as friends<br />
And catch the precious name this piece pretends,<br />
Make not too much haste t&rsquo; admire<br />
That fair-cheeked fallacy of fire.<br />
That is a seraphim, they say,<br />
And this the great Teresia.<br />
Readers, be ruled by me, and make<br />
Here a well-placed and wise mistake;<br />
You must transpose the picture quite,<br />
And spell it wrong to read it right;<br />
Read Him for Her, and Her for Him,<br />
And call the saint the seraphim.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Painter, what didst thou understand<br />
To put her dart into his hand?<br />
See, even the years and size of him<br />
Shows this the mother seraphim.<br />
This is the mistress flame, and duteous he<br />
Her happy fireworks, here, comes down to see:<br />
O, most poor-spirited of men!<br />
Had thy cold pencil kissed her pen,<br />
Thou couldst not so unkindly err<br />
To show us this faint shade for her.<br />
Why, man, this speaks pure mortal frame,<br />
And mocks with female frost love&rsquo;s manly flame;<br />
One would suspect thou meant&rsquo;st to paint<br />
Some weak, inferior woman Saint.<br />
But, had thy pale-faced purple took<br />
Fire from the burning cheeks of that bright book,<br />
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Thou
wouldst on her have heaped up all<br />
That could be found seraphical;<br />
Whate&rsquo;er this youth of fire wears fair,<br />
Rosy fingers, radiant hair,<br />
Glowing cheek, and glist&rsquo;ring wings,<br />
All those fair and flagrant things;<br />
But, before all, that fiery dart<br />
Had filled the hand of this great heart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do, then, as equal right requires,<br />
Since his the blushes be, and hers the fires,<br />
Resume and rectify thy rude design,<br />
Undress thy seraphim into mine;<br />
Redeem this injury of thy art,<br />
Give him the veil, give her the dart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give him the veil, that he may cover<br />
The red cheeks of a rivalled lover,<br />
Ashamed that our world now can show<br />
Nests of new Seraphims here below.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give her the dart, for it is she,<br />
Fair youth, shoots both thy shaft and thee;<br />
Say, all ye wise and well-pierced hearts<br />
That live and die amidst her darts,<br />
What is&rsquo;t your tasteful spirits do prove<br />
In that rare life of her and love?<br />
Say and bear witness.&nbsp; Sends she not<br />
A seraphim at every shot?<br />
What magazines of immortal arms there shine!<br />
Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s great artillery in each love-spun line!<br
/>
Give, then, the dart to her who gives the flame,<br />
Give him the veil who gives the shame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But if it be the frequent fate<br />
Of worst faults to be fortunate,<br />
If all&rsquo;s prescription, and proud wrong<br />
Hearkens not to an humble song,<br />
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>For all
the gallantry of him,<br />
Give me the suff&rsquo;ring seraphim.<br />
His be the bravery of those bright things,<br />
The glowing cheeks, the glistering wings,<br />
The rosy hand, the radiant dart;<br />
Leave her alone the flaming heart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave her that, and thou shalt leave her<br />
Not one loose shaft, but Love&rsquo;s whole quiver.<br />
For in Love&rsquo;s field was never found<br />
A nobler weapon than a wound.<br />
Love&rsquo;s passives are his activ&rsquo;st part,<br />
The wounded is the wounding heart.<br />
O, heart! the equal poise of Love&rsquo;s both parts,<br />
Big alike with wounds and darts,<br />
Live in these conquering leaves, live all the same,<br />
And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame!<br />
Live here, great heart, and love, and die, and kill,<br />
And bleed, and wound, and yield, and conquer still.<br />
Let this immortal Life, where&rsquo;er it comes,<br />
Walk in the crowd of loves and martyrdoms.<br />
Let mystic deaths wait on&rsquo;t, and wise souls be<br />
The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.<br />
O, sweet incendiary! show here thy art<br />
Upon this carcass of a hard, cold heart;<br />
Let all thy scattered shafts of light, that play<br />
Among the leaves of thy large books of day,<br />
Combined against this breast, at once break in<br />
And take away from me myself and sin;<br />
This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be,<br />
And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.<br />
O, thou undaunted daughter of desires!<br />

By all the eagle in thee, all the dove,<br />
By all thy lives and deaths of love,<br />

That seized thy parting soul, and sealed thee His;<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Poet</span> and Saint! to
thee alone are given<br />
The two most sacred names of earth and heaven;<br />
The hard and rarest union which can be,<br />
Next that of Godhead with humanity.<br />
Long did the muses banished slaves abide,<br />
And built vain pyramids to mortal pride;<br />
Like Moses, thou (though spells and charms withstand)<br />
Hast brought them nobly back home to their Holy Land.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, wretched we, poets of earth! but thou<br />
Wert living the same poet which thou&rsquo;rt now.<br />
Whilst angels sing to thee their airs divine,<br />
And join in an applause so great as thine,<br />
Equal society with them to hold,<br />
Thou need&rsquo;st not make new songs, but say the old.<br />
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>And they
(kind spirits!) shall all rejoice to see<br />
How little less than they exalted man may be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the old heathen gods in numbers dwell,<br />
The heavenliest thing on earth still keeps up hell.<br />
Nor have we yet quite purged the Christian land;<br />
Still idols here, like calves at Bethel, stand.<br />
And though Pan&rsquo;s death long since all oracles broke,<br />
Yet still in rhyme the fiend Apollo spoke:<br />
Nay, with the worst of heathen dotage we<br />
(Vain men!) the monster woman deify;<br />
Find stars, and tie our fates there in a face,<br />
And paradise in them, by whom we lost it, place.<br />
What different faults corrupt our muses thus!<br />
Wanton as girls, as old wives fabulous!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy spotless muse, like Mary, did contain<br />
The boundless Godhead; she did well disdain<br />
That her eternal verse employed should be<br />
On a less subject than eternity;<br />
And for a sacred mistress scorned to take<br />
But her whom God Himself scorned not His spouse to make.<br />
It (in a kind) her miracle did do;<br />
A fruitful mother was and virgin too.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How well, blest swan, did Fate contrive thy
death,<br />
And make thee render up thy tuneful breath<br />
In thy great Mistress&rsquo; arms, thou most divine<br />
And richest offering of Loretto&rsquo;s shrine!<br />
Where, like some holy sacrifice to expire,<br />
A fever burns thee, and love lights the fire.<br />
Angels (they say) brought the famed chapel there,<br />
And bore the sacred load in triumph through the air.<br />
&rsquo;Tis surer much they brought <i>thee</i> there, and they<br
/>
And thou, their charge, went singing all the way.</p>

Opposed by our old enemy, adverse chance,<br />
Attacked by envy and by ignorance,<br />
Enchained by beauty, tortured by desires,<br />
Exposed by tyrant love to savage beasts and fires.<br />
Thou from low earth in nobler flames didst rise,<br />
And, like Elijah, mount alive the skies.<br />
Elisha-like (but with a wish much less,<br />
More fit thy greatness and my littleness),<br />
Lo, here I beg (I, whom thou once didst prove<br />
So humble to esteem, so good to love)<br />
Not that thy spirit might on me doubled be&mdash;<br />

ALTHEA, FROM PRISON</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> love with
unconfined wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hovers within my gates,<br />
And my divine Althea brings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whisper at the grates;<br />
When I lie tangled in her hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fettered to her eye;<br />
The birds that wanton in the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know no such liberty.</p>
<p class="poetry">When flowing cups run swiftly round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With no allaying Thames,<br />
Our careless heads with roses crowned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hearts with loyal flames;<br />
When thirsty grief in wine we steep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When healths and draughts go free,<br />
Fishes that tipple in the deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know no such liberty.</p>
<p class="poetry">When (like committed linnets) I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With shriller throat shall sing<br />
The sweetness, mercy, majesty<br />

When I shall voice aloud how good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is, how great should be,<br />
Enlarged winds that curl the flood<br />

O they but closely, closely kiss.</p>

The people do not mock, but pray,<br />
And call thee, as amazed they run,<br />
Instead of prostitute, a nun.</p>

<h3>A HORATIAN ODE UPON CROMWELL&rsquo;S RETURN FROM IRELAND</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> forward youth
that would appear<br />
Must now forsake his muses dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor in the shadows sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His numbers languishing.<br />
&rsquo;Tis time to leave the books in dust,<br />
And oil the unused armour&rsquo;s rust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing from the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corselet of the hall.<br />
So restless Cromwell could not cease<br />
In the inglorious arts of peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But through adventurous war<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urged his active star;<br />
And, like the three-forked lightning, first<br />
Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did thorough his own side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His fiery way divide;<br />
(For &rsquo;tis all one to courage high,<br />
The emulous, or enemy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>And with such to enclose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is more than to oppose;)<br />
Then burning through the air he went,<br />
And palaces and temples rent;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s head at
last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did through his laurels blast.<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis madness to resist or blame<br />
The force of angry heaven&rsquo;s flame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if we would speak true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much to the man is due,<br />
Who, from his private gardens, where<br />
He lived reserved and austere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if his highest plot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To plant the bergamot,<br />
Could by industrious valour climb<br />
To ruin the great work of Time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cast the kingdoms old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into another mould.<br />
Though Justice against Fate complain<br />
And plead the ancient rights in vain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (But those do hold or break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As men are strong or weak),<br />
Nature, that hateth emptiness,<br />
Allows of penetration less,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore must make room<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where greater spirits come.<br />
What field of all the civil war<br />
Where his were not the deepest scar?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Hampton shows what part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had of wiser art;<br />
Where, twining subtle fears with hope,<br />
He wove a net of such a scope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Charles himself might
chase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Carisbrook&rsquo;s narrow
case,<br />
<a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>That
thence the royal actor borne<br />
The tragic scaffold might adorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While round the armed bands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did clap their bloody hands;<br />
He nothing common did, or mean,<br />
Upon that memorable scene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with his keener eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The axe&rsquo;s edge did try;<br
/>
Nor called the gods with vulgar spite<br />
To vindicate his helpless right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But bowed his comely head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down, as upon a bed.<br />
This was that memorable hour,<br />
Which first assured the forced power;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, when they did design<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The capitol&rsquo;s first line,<br

A bleeding head, where they begun,<br />
Did fright the architects to run;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet in that the State<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foresaw its happy fate.<br />
And now the Irish are ashamed<br />
To see themselves in one year tamed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much one man can do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That does both act and know.<br />
They can affirm his praises best,<br />
And have, though overcome, confessed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How good he is, how just,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fit for highest trust;<br />
Nor yet grown stiffer with command,<br />
But still in the republic&rsquo;s hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (How fit he is to sway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can so well obey!)<br />
He to the Commons&rsquo; feet presents<br />
A kingdom for his first year&rsquo;s rents;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>And, what he may, forbears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His fame, to make it theirs;<br />
And has his sword and spoil ungirt,<br />
To lay them at the Public&rsquo;s skirt:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when the falcon high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Falls heavy from the sky,<br />
She, having killed, no more doth search,<br />
But on the next green bough to perch;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, when he first does lure,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The falconer has her sure.<br />
What may not then our isle presume,<br />
While victory his crest does plume?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What may not others fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thus he crowns each year?<br />
As Caesar, he, ere long, to Gaul,<br />
To Italy a Hannibal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to all states not free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall climacteric be.<br />
The Pict no shelter now shall find<br />
Within his parti-coloured mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, from this valour sad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrink underneath the plaid;<br />
Happy, if in the tufted brake<br />
The English hunter him mistake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor lay his hounds in near<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Caledonian deer.<br />
But thou, the war&rsquo;s and fortune&rsquo;s son,<br />
March indefatigably on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the last effect,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still keep the sword erect;<br />
Beside the force it has to fright<br />
The spirits of the shady night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same arts that did gain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A power, must it maintain.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> wanton troopers
riding by<br />
Have shot my fawn, and it will die.<br />
Ungentle men! they cannot thrive<br />
Who killed thee.&nbsp; Thou ne&rsquo;er didst, alive,<br />
Them any harm, alas! nor could<br />
Thy death yet ever do them good.<br />
I&rsquo;m sure I never wished them ill,<br />
Nor do I for all this, nor will.<br />
But if my simple prayers may yet<br />
Prevail with heaven to forget<br />
Thy murder, I will join my tears<br />
Rather than fail.&nbsp; But O my fears!<br />
It cannot die so.&nbsp; Heaven&rsquo;s King<br />
Keeps register of everything,<br />
And nothing may we use in vain;<br />
Even beasts must be with justice slain,<br />
Else men are made their deodands.<br />
Though they should wash their guilty hands<br />
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>In this
warm life-blood which doth part<br />
From thine, and wound me to the heart,<br />
Yet could they not be clean, their stain<br />
Is dyed in such a purple grain.<br />
There is not such another in<br />
The world, to offer for their sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Inconstant Sylvio, when yet<br />
I had not found him counterfeit,<br />
One morning (I remember well),<br />
Tied in this silver chain and bell,<br />
Gave it to me; nay, and I know<br />
What he said then, I&rsquo;m sure I do:<br />
Said he, &lsquo;Look how your huntsman here<br />
Hath taught a fawn to hunt his deer!&rsquo;<br />
But Sylvio soon had me beguiled;<br />
This waxed tame while he grew wild,<br />
And quite regardless of my smart<br />
Left me his fawn, but took my heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thenceforth I set myself to play<br />
My solitary time away<br />
With this; and, very well content,<br />
Could so mine idle life have spent;<br />
For it was full of sport, and light<br />
Of foot and heart, and did invite<br />
Me to its game; it seemed to bless<br />
Itself in me; how could I less<br />
Than love it?&nbsp; O, I cannot be<br />
Unkind to a beast that loveth me!</p>
<p class="poetry">Had it lived long, I do not know<br />
Whether it too might have done so<br />
As Sylvio did; his gifts might be<br />
Perhaps as false, or more, than he.<br />
<a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>But I am
sure, for aught that I<br />
Could in so short a time espy,<br />
Thy love was far more better than<br />
The love of false and cruel man.</p>
<p class="poetry">With sweetest milk and sugar first<br />
I it at my own fingers nursed;<br />
And as it grew, so every day<br />
It waxed more white and sweet than they&mdash;<br />
It had so sweet a breath! and oft<br />
I blushed to see its foot more soft<br />
And white&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;than my hand,<br />
Nay, any lady&rsquo;s of the land!</p>
<p class="poetry">It is a wondrous thing how fleet<br />
&rsquo;Twas on those little silver feet:<br />
With what a pretty skipping grace<br />
It oft would challenge me the race:&mdash;<br />
And when &rsquo;t had left me far away<br />
&rsquo;Twould stay, and run again, and stay;<br />
For it was nimbler much than hinds,<br />
And trod as if on the four winds.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have a garden of my own,<br />
But so with roses overgrown<br />
And lilies, that you would it guess<br />
To be a little wilderness:<br />
And all the spring-time of the year<br />
It only loved to be there.<br />
Among the beds of lilies I<br />
Have sought it oft, where it should lie;<br />
Yet could not, till itself would rise,<br />
Find it, although before mine eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>For in the flaxen lilies&rsquo; shade<br />
It like a bank of lilies laid.<br />
Upon the roses it would feed,<br />
Until its lips e&rsquo;en seemed to bleed,<br />
And then to me &rsquo;twould boldly trip,<br />
And print those roses on my lip.<br />
But all its chief delight was still<br />
On roses thus itself to fill,<br />
And its pure virgin limbs to fold<br />
In whitest sheets of lilies cold:&mdash;<br />
Had it lived long, it would have been<br />
Lilies without&mdash;roses within.</p>
<p class="poetry">O help!&nbsp; O help!&nbsp; I see it faint<br
/>
And die as calmly as a saint!<br />
See how it weeps! the tears do come<br />
Sad, slowly, dropping like a gum.<br />
So weeps the wounded balsam; so<br />
The holy frankincense doth flow;<br />
The brotherless Heliades<br />
Melt in such amber tears as these.</p>
<p class="poetry">I in a golden vial will<br />
Keep these two crystal tears, and fill<br />
It, till it doth o&rsquo;erflow, with mine,<br />
Then place it in Diana&rsquo;s shrine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now my sweet fawn is vanished to<br />
Whither the swans and turtles go;<br />
In fair Elysium to endure<br />
With milk-white lambs and ermines pure.<br />
O, do not run too fast, for I<br />
Will but bespeak thy grave, and die.<br />
<a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>First my
unhappy statue shall<br />
Be cut in marble; and withal<br />
Let it be weeping too; but there<br />
The engraver sure his art may spare;<br />
For I so truly thee bemoan<br />
That I shall weep though I be stone,<br />
Until my tears, still dropping, wear<br />
My breast, themselves engraving there;<br />
Then at my feet shalt thou be laid,<br />
Of purest alabaster made;<br />
For I would have thine image be<br />
White as I can, though not as thee.</p>
<h3>THE DEFINITION OF LOVE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> love is of a
birth as rare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As &rsquo;tis, for object, strange and high;<br />
It was begotten by despair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon impossibility.</p>
<p class="poetry">Magnanimous despair alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could show me so divine a thing,<br />
Where feeble hope could ne&rsquo;er have flown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But vainly flapped its tinsel wing.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet I quickly might arrive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where my extended soul is fixed;<br />
But fate does iron wedges drive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And always crowds itself betwixt.</p>
<p class="poetry">For fate with jealous eyes does see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two perfect loves, nor lets them close;<br />
Their union would her ruin be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her tyrannic power depose.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>And therefore her decrees of steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Us as the distant poles have placed<br />
(Though Love&rsquo;s whole world on us doth wheel),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not by themselves to be embraced,</p>
<p class="poetry">Unless the giddy heaven fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And earth some new convulsion tear,<br />
And, us to join, the world should all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be cramped into a planisphere.</p>
<p class="poetry">As lines, so loves oblique may well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Themselves in every angle greet;<br />
But ours, so truly parallel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though infinite, can never meet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Therefore the love which us doth bind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But fate so enviously debars,<br />
Is the conjunction of the mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And opposition of the stars.</p>
<h3>THE GARDEN</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Translated out of his own
Latin</i></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">How</span> vainly men
themselves amaze<br />
To win the palm, the oak, or bays,<br />
And their incessant labours see<br />
Crowned from some single herb or tree,<br />
Whose short and narrow-verged shade<br />
Does prudently their toils upbraid;<br />
While all the flowers and trees do close<br />
To weave the garlands of Repose.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,<br />
And Innocence thy sister dear?<br />
Mistaken long, I sought you then<br />
In busy companies of men:<br />
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Your
sacred plants, if here below,<br />
Only among the plants will grow:<br />
Society is all but rude<br />
To this delicious solitude.</p>
<p class="poetry">No white nor red was ever seen<br />
So amorous as this lovely green.<br />
Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,<br />
Cut in these trees their mistress&rsquo; name:<br />
Little, alas, they know or heed<br />
How far these beauties her exceed!<br />
Fair trees! wheres&rsquo;e&rsquo;er your barks I wound,<br />
No name shall, but your own, be found.</p>
<p class="poetry">When we have run our passions&rsquo; heat<br />
Love hither makes his best retreat;<br />
The gods, who mortal beauty chase,<br />
Stall in a tree did end their race;<br />
Apollo hunted Daphne so<br />
Only that she might laurel grow;<br />
And Pan did after Syrinx speed<br />
Not as a nymph, but for a reed.</p>
<p class="poetry">What wondrous life is this I lead!<br />
Ripe apples drop about my head;<br />
The luscious clusters of the vine<br />
Upon my mouth do crush their wine;<br />
The nectarine and curious peach<br />
Into my hands themselves do reach;<br />
Stumbling on melons, as I pass,<br />
Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,<br />
Withdraws into its happiness;<br />
<a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>The
mind, that ocean where each kind<br />
Does straight its own resemblance find;<br />
Yet it creates, transcending these,<br />
Far other worlds and other seas;<br />
Annihilating all that&rsquo;s made<br />
To a green thought in a green shade.</p>
<p class="poetry">Here at the fountain&rsquo;s sliding foot<br />
Or at some fruit-tree&rsquo;s mossy root,<br />
Casting the body&rsquo;s vest aside<br />
My soul into the boughs does glide;<br />
There, like a bird, it sits and sings,<br />
Then whets and claps its silver wings,<br />
And, till prepared for longer flight,<br />
Waves in its plumes the various light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such was that happy Garden-state<br />
While man there walked without a mate:<br />
After a place so pure and sweet,<br />
What other help could yet be meet!<br />
But &rsquo;twas beyond a mortal&rsquo;s share<br />
To wander solitary there:<br />
Two paradises &rsquo;twere in one,<br />
To live in Paradise alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">How well the skilful gardener drew<br />
Of flowers and herbs this dial new!<br />
Where, from above, the milder sun<br />
Does through a fragrant zodiac run:<br />
And, as it works, th&rsquo; industrious bee<br />
Computes its time as well as we.<br />
How could such sweet and wholesome hours<br />
Be reckoned, but with herbs and flowers?</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ah</span>! what time wilt
Thou come?&nbsp; When shall that cry,<br />
&lsquo;The Bridegroom&rsquo;s coming!&rsquo; fill the sky?<br />
Shall it in the evening run,<br />
When our words and works are done?<br />
Or will Thy all-surprising light<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Break at midnight,<br />
When either sleep or some dark pleasure<br />
Possesseth mad man without measure?<br />
Or shall these early, fragrant hours<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unlock Thy bowers?<br />
And with their blush of light descry<br />
Thy locks crowned with eternity?<br />
Indeed it is the only time<br />
That with Thy glory best doth chime;<br />
All now are stirring, every field<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Full hymns doth yield;<br />
The whole creation shakes off night,<br />
And for Thy shadow looks the light;<br />
Stars now vanish without number,<br />
Sleepy planets set and slumber,<br />
The pursy clouds disband and scatter,<br />
All expect some sudden matter;<br />
Not one beam triumphs, but from far<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That morning star.<br />
O at what time soever Thou,<br />
Unknown to us, the heavens wilt bow,<br />
And, with Thy angels in the van,<br />
<a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>Descend
to judge poor careless man,<br />
Grant I may not like puddle lie<br />
In a corrupt security,<br />
Where, if a traveller water crave,<br />
He finds it dead, and in a grave;<br />
But as this restless vocal spring<br />
All day and night doth run and sing,<br />
And, though here born, yet is acquainted<br />
Elsewhere, and flowing keeps untainted;<br />
So let me all my busy age<br />
In Thy free services engage;<br />
And though&mdash;while here&mdash;of force I must<br />
Have commerce sometimes with poor dust,<br />
And in my flesh, though vile and low,<br />
As this doth in her channel flow,<br />
Yet let my course, my aim, my love,<br />
And chief acquaintance be above;<br />
So when that day and hour shall come,<br />
In which Thy Self will be the sun,<br />
Thou&rsquo;lt find me dressed and on my way,<br />
Watching the break of Thy great day.</p>
<h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">cannot</span> reach it;
and my striving eye<br />
Dazzles at it, as at eternity.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were now
that chronicle alive,<br />
Those white designs which children drive,<br />
And the thoughts of each harmless hour,<br />
With their content too in my power,<br />
Quickly would I make my path even,<br />
And by mere playing go to heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>Why should
men love<br />
A wolf, more than a lamb or dove?<br />
Or choose hell-fire and brimstone streams<br />
Before bright stars and God&rsquo;s own beams?<br />
Who kisseth thorns will hurt his face,<br />
But flowers do both refresh and grace;<br />
And sweetly living&mdash;fie on men!&mdash;<br />
Are, when dead, medicinal then;<br />
If seeing much should make staid eyes,<br />
And long experience should make wise;<br />
Since all that age doth teach is ill,<br />
Why should I not love childhood still?<br />
Why, if I see a rock or shelf,<br />
Shall I from thence cast down myself?<br />
Or by complying with the world,<br />
From the same precipice be hurled?<br />
Those observations are but foul,<br />
Which make me wise to lose my soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet the practice worldlings call<br />
Business, and weighty action all,<br />
Checking the poor child for his play,<br />
But gravely cast themselves away.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear, harmless age! the short, swift span<br />
Where weeping Virtue parts with man;<br />
Where love without lust dwells, and bends<br />
What way we please without self-ends.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An age of
mysteries! which he<br />
Must live twice that would God&rsquo;s face see;<br />
Which angels guard, and with it play;<br />
Angels! which foul men drive away.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>How do I
study now, and scan<br />
Thee more than e&rsquo;er I studied man,<br />
And only see through a long night<br />
Thy edges and thy bordering light!<br />
O for thy centre and mid-day!<br />
For sure that is the narrow way!</p>
<h3>CORRUPTION</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sure</span> it was
so.&nbsp; Man in those early days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was not all stone and earth;<br />
He shined a little, and by those weak rays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had some glimpse of his birth.<br
/>
He saw heaven o&rsquo;er his head, and knew from whence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came, condemned, hither;<br />
And, as first-love draws strongest, so from hence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mind sure progressed
thither.<br />
Things here were strange unto him; sweat and till;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All was a thorn or weed;<br />
Nor did those last, but&mdash;like himself&mdash;died still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they did seed;<br />
They seemed to quarrel with him; for that act,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That fell him, foiled them all;<br
/>
He drew the curse upon the world, and cracked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole frame with his fall.<br
/>
This made him long for home, as loth to stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With murmurers and foes;<br />
He sighed for Eden, and would often say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! what bright days were
those!&rsquo;<br />
Nor was heaven cold unto him; for each day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The valley or the mountain<br />
Afforded visits, and still Paradise lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some green shade or
fountain.<br />
<a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Angels
lay leiger here; each bush, and cell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each oak and highway knew them:<br
/>
Walk but the fields, or sit down at some well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was sure to view them.<br
/>
Almighty Love! where art Thou now? mad man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sits down and freezeth on;<br />
He raves, and swears to stir nor fire, nor fan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But bids the thread be spun.<br />
I see Thy curtains are close-drawn; Thy bow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks dim, too, in the cloud;<br
/>
Sin triumphs still, and man is sunk below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The centre, and his shroud.<br />
All&rsquo;s in deep sleep and night: thick darkness lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hatcheth o&rsquo;er Thy
people&mdash;<br />
But hark! what trumpet&rsquo;s that? what angel cries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Arise! thrust in Thy
sickle&rsquo;?</p>
<h3>THE NIGHT</h3>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Through</span> that pure virgin shrine,<br />
That sacred veil drawn o&rsquo;er Thy glorious noon,<br />
That men might look and live, as glow-worms shine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And face the
moon:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise Nicodemus saw such light<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As made him know his God by
night.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
blest believer he!<br />
Who in that land of darkness and blind eyes<br />
Thy long-expected healing wings could see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Thou didst
rise!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, what can never more be
done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did at midnight speak with the
Sun!</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>O, who will
tell me where<br />
He found Thee at that dead and silent hour?<br />
What hallowed solitary ground did bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So rare a
flower;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within whose sacred leaves did
lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fulness of the Deity?</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
mercy-seat of gold,<br />
No dead and dusty cherub nor carved stone,<br />
But His own living works did my Lord hold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lodge
alone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where trees and herbs did watch,
and peep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wonder, while the Jews did
sleep.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear
night! this world&rsquo;s defeat;<br />
The stop to busy fools; care&rsquo;s check and curb;<br />
The day of spirits; my soul&rsquo;s calm retreat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which none
disturb!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s progress, and His
prayer-time;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hours to which high Heaven
doth chime.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s
silent, searching flight;<br />
When my Lord&rsquo;s head is filled with dew, and all<br />
His locks are wet with the clear drops of night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His still, soft
call;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His knocking-time; the
soul&rsquo;s dumb watch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When spirits their fair kindred
catch.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were
my loud, evil days<br />
Calm and unhaunted as is thy dark tent,<br />
Whose peace but by some angel&rsquo;s wing or voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is seldom
rent;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I in heaven all the long
year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would keep, and never wander
here.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>But living
where the sun<br />
Doth all things wake, and where all mix and tire<br />
Themselves and others, I consent and run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To every
mire;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by this world&rsquo;s
ill-guiding light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err more than I can do by
night.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is in God&mdash;some say&mdash;<br />
A deep but dazzling darkness; as men here<br />
Say it is late and dusky, because they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See not all
clear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O for that night! where I in
Him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might live invisible and dim!</p>
<h3>THE ECLIPSE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Whither</span>, O whither
didst Thou fly,<br />
When I did grieve Thine holy eye?<br />
When Thou didst mourn to see me lost,<br />
And all Thy care and counsels crossed?<br />
O do not grieve, where&rsquo;er Thou art!<br />
Thy grief is an undoing smart,<br />
Which doth not only pain, but break<br />
My heart, and makes me blush to speak.<br />
Thy anger I could kiss, and will;<br />
But O Thy grief, Thy grief, doth kill!</p>
<h3>THE RETREAT</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Happy</span> those early
days when I<br />
Shined in my angel infancy!<br />
Before I understood this place<br />
Appointed for my second race,<br />
Or taught my soul to fancy ought<br />
<a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>But a
white, celestial thought;<br />
When yet I had not walked above<br />
A mile or two from my first love,<br />
And looking back, at that short space,<br />
Could see a glimpse of his bright face;<br />
When on some gilded cloud or flower<br />
My gazing soul would dwell an hour,<br />
And in those weaker glories spy<br />
Some shadows of eternity;<br />
Before I taught my tongue to wound<br />
My conscience with a sinful sound,<br />
Or had the black art to dispense<br />
A several sin to every sense;<br />
But felt through all this fleshly dress<br />
Bright shoots of everlastingness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O how I long to travel back,<br />
And tread again that ancient track!<br />
That I might once more reach that plain<br />
Where first I left my glorious train;<br />
From whence the enlightened spirit sees<br />
That shady city of palm-trees.<br />
But ah! my soul with too much stay<br />
Is drunk, and staggers in the way!<br />
Some men a forward motion love,<br />
But I by backward steps would move;<br />
And, when this dust falls to the urn,<br />
In that state I came, return.</p>
<h3>THE WORLD OF LIGHT</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">They</span> are all gone
into the world of light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I alone sit lingering here;<br />
Their very memory is fair and bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my sad thoughts doth clear.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like stars upon some gloomy grove,<br />
Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sun&rsquo;s remove.</p>
<p class="poetry">I see them walking in an air of glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose light doth trample on my days:<br />
My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mere glimmering and decays.</p>
<p class="poetry">O holy Hope! and high Humility,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High as the heavens above!<br />
These are your walks, and you have shewed them me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To kindle my cold love.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the
just,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shining no where, but in the dark;<br />
What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could man outlook that mark!</p>
<p class="poetry">He that hath found some fledged bird&rsquo;s
nest, may know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight, if the bird be flown;<br />
But what fair well or grove he sings in now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is to him unknown.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet, as Angels in some brighter dreams<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Call to the soul, when man doth sleep:<br />
So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And into glory peep.</p>
<p class="poetry">If a star were confined into a tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her captive flames must needs burn there;<br />
But when the hand that locked her up gives room,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll shine through all the sphere.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>O Father of eternal life, and all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Created glories under Thee!<br />
Resume Thy spirit from this world of thrall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into true liberty.</p>
<p class="poetry">Either disperse these mists, which blot and
fill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My perspective still as they pass;<br />
Or else remove me hence unto that hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where I shall need no glass.</p>

Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,<br />
Thou roll&rsquo;st above us in thy wandering race,<br />

Moved with the heaven&rsquo;s majestic pace,<br />

Was formed at first with myriads more,<br />

Who Greek or Latin laurels wore,<br />

From thy bright eyes he took his fires,<br />

As into air the purer spirits flow,<br />
And sep&rsquo;rate from their kindred dregs below;<br />
So flew the soul to its congenial place,<br />
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,<br />
Thou mean deserter of thy brother&rsquo;s blood!<br />
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,<br />
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death;<br />
Cold is that breath which warmed the world before,<br />
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.<br />
Thus, if Eternal Justice rules the ball,<br />
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall:<br />
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,<br />
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates;<br />
<a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>There
passengers shall stand, and pointing say<br />
(While the long fun&rsquo;rals blacken all the way),<br />
&lsquo;Lo! these were they whose souls the Furies steeled,<br />
And cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield.<br />
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,<br />
The gaze of fools, and pageants of a day!<br />
So perish all whose breasts ne&rsquo;er learned to glow<br />
For others&rsquo; good, or melt at others&rsquo; woe.&rsquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What can atone (O ever injured shade!)<br />
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?<br />
No friend&rsquo;s complaint, no kind domestic tear<br />
Pleased thy pale ghost, or graced thy mournful bier:<br />
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,<br />
By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed,<br />
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorned,<br />
By strangers honoured and by strangers mourned.<br />
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,<br />
Grieve for an hour perhaps, then mourn a year,<br />
And bear about the mockery of woe<br />
To midnight dances, and the public show?<br />
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,<br />
Nor polished marble emulate thy face?<br />
What though no sacred earth allow thee room,<br />
Nor hallowed dirge be muttered o&rsquo;er thy tomb?<br />
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow&rsquo;rs be dressed,<br />
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:<br />
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,<br />
There the first roses of the year shall blow;<br />
While angels with their silver wings o&rsquo;ershade<br />
The ground, now sacred by thy relics made.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,<br />
What once had beauty, titles, wealth and fame.<br />
How loved, how honoured once, avails thee not,<br />
To whom related, or by whom begot;<br />
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>A heap
of dust alone remains of thee:<br />
&rsquo;Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,<br
/>
Deaf the praised ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.<br />
Ev&rsquo;n he whose soul now melts in mournful lays<br />
Shall shortly want the gen&rsquo;rous tear he pays;<br />
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,<br />
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart:<br />
Life&rsquo;s idle business at one gasp be o&rsquo;er,<br />
The Muse forgot, and thou beloved no more!</p>

<h3>LINES ON RECEIVING HIS MOTHER&rsquo;S PICTURE</h3>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">that</span> those lips
had language!&nbsp; Life has passed<br />
With me but roughly since I heard thee last.<br />
Those lips are thine&mdash;thy own sweet smiles I see,<br />
The same that oft in childhood solaced me;<br />
Voice only fails, else how distinct they say,<br />
&lsquo;Grieve not, my child&mdash;chase all thy fears
away!&rsquo;<br />
The meek intelligence of those dear eyes<br />
(Blest be the art that can immortalise,<br />
The art that baffles Time&rsquo;s tyrannic claim<br />
To quench it) here shines on me still the same.<br />
Faithful remembrancer of one so dear,<br />
O welcome guest, though unexpected here!<br />
Who bid&rsquo;st me honour with an artless song,<br />
Affectionate, a mother lost so long.<br />
I will obey, not willingly alone,<br />
But gladly, as the precept were her own:<br />
<a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>And
while that face renews my filial grief,<br />
Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief,<br />
Shall steep me in Elysian reverie,<br />
A momentary dream, that thou art she.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother! when I learnt that thou wast dead,<br />
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?<br />
Hovered thy spirit o&rsquo;er thy sorrowing son,<br />
Wretch even then, life&rsquo;s journey just begun?<br />
Perhaps thou gav&rsquo;st me, though unseen, a kiss;<br />
Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss&mdash;<br />
Ah, that maternal smile! it answers&mdash;yes.<br />
I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day,<br />
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,<br />
And, turning from my nursery window, drew<br />
A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!<br />
But was it such?&mdash;It was.&mdash;Where thou art gone<br />
Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.<br />
May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore<br />
The parting word shall pass my lips no more!<br />
Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,<br />
Oft gave me promise of thy quick return.<br />
What ardently I wished, I long believed,<br />
And, disappointed still, was still deceived,<br />
By expectation every day beguiled,<br />
Dupe of <i>to-morrow</i> even from a child.<br />
Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,<br />
Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent,<br />
I learnt at last submission to my lot,<br />
But though I less deplored thee, ne&rsquo;er forgot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more,<br />
Children not thine have trod my nursery floor;<br />
And where the gardener Robin, day by day,<br />
Drew me to school along the public way,<br />
Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapped<br />
<a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>In
scarlet mantle warm, and velvet-capt,<br />
&rsquo;Tis now become a history little known,<br />
That once we called the pastoral house our own.<br />
Short-lived possession! but the record fair<br />
That memory keeps of all thy kindness there,<br />
Still outlives many a storm, that has effaced<br />
A thousand other themes less deeply traced:<br />
Thy nightly visits to my chamber paid<br />
That thou might&rsquo;st know me safe and warmly laid;<br />
Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,<br />
The biscuit, or confectionary plum;<br />
The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed<br />
By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glowed;<br />
All this, and more endearing still than all,<br />
Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er roughened by those cataracts and breaks,<br />
That humour interposed too often makes;<br />
All this still legible in memory&rsquo;s page,<br />
And still to be so till my latest age,<br />
Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay<br />
Such honours to thee as my numbers may;<br />
Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,<br />
Not scorned in heaven, though little noticed here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the
hours,<br />
When, playing with thy vesture&rsquo;s tissued flowers,<br />
The violet, the pink, the jessamine,<br />
I pricked them into paper with a pin<br />
(And thou wast happier than myself the while,<br />
Wouldst softly speak, and stroke my head and smile),<br />
Could those few pleasant days again appear,<br />
Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?<br />
I would not trust my heart&mdash;the dear delight<br />
Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might&mdash;<br />
But no&mdash;what here we call our life is such,<br />
<a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>So
little to be loved, and thou so much,<br />
That I should ill requite thee to constrain<br />
Thy unbound spirit into bonds again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion&rsquo;s coast<br
/>
(The storms all weathered and the ocean crossed),<br />
Shoots into port at some well-havened isle,<br />
Where spices breathe, and brighter seasons smile,<br />
There sits quiescent on the floods, that show<br />
Her beauteous form reflected clear below,<br />
While airs impregnated with incense play<br />
Around her, fanning light her streamers gay;<br />
So thou, with sails how swift! hast reached the shore,<br />
&lsquo;Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,&rsquo;<br />
And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide<br />
Of life, long since has anchored at thy side.<br />
But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,<br />
Always from port withheld, always distressed&mdash;<br />
Me howling winds drive devious, tempest-tossed,<br />
Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and compass lost,<br />
And day by day some current&rsquo;s thwarting force<br />
Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.<br />
Yet, O the thought that thou art safe, and he!<br />
That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.<br />
My boast is not that I deduce my birth<br />
From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;<br />
But higher far my proud pretensions rise&mdash;<br />
The son of parents passed into the skies.<br />
And now, farewell&mdash;Time unrevoked has run<br />
His wonted course, yet what I wished is done.<br />
By contemplation&rsquo;s help, not sought in vain,<br />
I seem to have lived my childhood o&rsquo;er again;<br />
To have renewed the joys that once were mine,<br />
Without the sin of violating thine;<br />
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>And,
while the wings of Fancy still are free,<br />
And I can view this mimic show of thee,<br />
Time has but half succeeded in his theft&mdash;<br />
Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.</p>

<h3>THE LAND OF DREAMS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Awake</span>, awake, my
little boy!<br />
Thou wast thy mother&rsquo;s only joy.<br />
Why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep?<br />
Awake, thy Father does thee keep.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&lsquo;O, what land is the Land of Dreams,<br />
What are its mountains and what are its streams?<br />
O father, I saw my mother there,<br />
Among the lilies by waters fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Among the lambs clothed in white,<br />
She walked with her Thomas in sweet delight;<br />
I wept for joy, like a dove I mourn,<br />
O, when shall I again return?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear child, I also by pleasant streams<br />
Have wandered all night in the Land of Dreams,<br />

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Piper, sit thee down and write<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a hook that all may read&rsquo;:<br />
So he vanished from my sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I plucked a hollow reed;</p>

And I wrote my happy songs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every child may joy to hear.</p>
<h3>HOLY THURSDAY</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">&rsquo;Twas</span> on a
Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,<br />
Came children walking two and two, in red, and blue, and
green;<br />
Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as
snow,<br />
Till into the high dome of Paul&rsquo;s they like Thames waters
flow.</p>
<p class="poetry">O what a multitude they seemed, these flowers
of London town!<br />
Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own;<br />
The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,<br />
Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent
hands.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Now, like a mighty wind, they raise to heaven the voice

Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among;<br />
Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor.<br />
Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.</p>
<h3>THE TIGER</h3>

burning bright<br />
In the forests of the night,<br />
What immortal hand or eye<br />
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?</p>

Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br />
On what wings dare he aspire?<br />
What the hand dare seize the fire?</p>
<p class="poetry">And what shoulder, and what art,<br />
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br />
And when thy heart began to beat,<br />
What dread hand and what dread feet?</p>
<p class="poetry">What the hammer? what the chain?<br />
In what furnace was thy brain?<br />
What the anvil? what dread grasp<br />
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?</p>
<p class="poetry">When the stars threw down their spears,<br />
And watered heaven with their tears,<br />
Did he smile his work to see?<br />
Did He who made the lamb make thee?</p>

Or the blue regions of the air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the melodious winds have birth;</p>
<p class="poetry">Whether on crystal rocks ye rove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the bosom of the sea,<br />
Wandering in many a coral grove,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair Nine, forsaking Poetry;</p>
<p class="poetry">How have you left the ancient love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That bards of old enjoyed in you!<br />

The homely beauty of the good old cause<br />
Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence,<br />
And pure religion breathing household laws.</p>

228</span>SURPRISED BY JOY</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Surprised</span> by
joy&mdash;impatient as the wind&mdash;<br />
I turned to share the transport&mdash;O! with whom<br />
But thee&mdash;deep buried in the silent tomb,<br />
That spot which no vicissitude can find?<br />
Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind&mdash;<br />
But how could I forget thee?&nbsp; Through what power,<br />
Even for the least division of an hour,<br />
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind<br />
To my most grievous loss!&mdash;That thought&rsquo;s return<br />
Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,<br />
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,<br />
Knowing my heart&rsquo;s best treasure was no more;<br />
That neither present time nor years unborn<br />
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.</p>
<h3>TO TOUSSAINT L&rsquo;OUVERTURE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Toussaint</span>, the most
unhappy man of men!<br />
Whether the all-cheering sun be free to shed<br />
His beams around thee, or thou rest thy head<br />
Pillowed in some dark dungeon&rsquo;s noisome den&mdash;<br />
O miserable chieftain! where and when<br />
Wilt thou find patience?&nbsp; Yet die not; do thou<br />
Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow:<br />
Though fallen thyself, never to rise again,<br />
Live and take comfort.&nbsp; Thou hast left behind<br />
Powers that will work for thee: air, earth, and skies;<br />
There&rsquo;s not a breathing of the common wind<br />
That will forget thee; thou hast great allies;<br />
Thy friends are exultations, agonies,<br />
And love, and man&rsquo;s unconquerable mind.</p>

SHIPS THE SEA WAS SPRINKLED</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">With</span> ships the sea
was sprinkled far and nigh,<br />
Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed;<br />
Some lying fast at anchor in the road,<br />
Some veering up and down, one knew not why.<br />
A goodly vessel did I then espy<br />
Come like a giant from a haven broad;<br />
And lustily along the bay she strode,<br />
&lsquo;Her tackling rich, and of apparel high.&rsquo;<br />
This ship was naught to me, nor I to her,<br />
Yet I pursued her with a lover&rsquo;s look;<br />
This ship to all the rest did I prefer:<br />
When will she turn, and whither?&nbsp; She will brook<br />
No tarrying; where she comes the winds must stir:<br />
On went she&mdash;and due north her journey took.</p>
<h3>THE WORLD</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> World is too
much with us; late and soon,<br />
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;<br />
Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br />
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!<br />
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,<br />
The winds that will be howling at all hours<br />
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,&mdash;<br />
For this, for every thing, we are out of tune;<br />
It moves us not.&mdash;Great God! I&rsquo;d rather be<br />
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn,&mdash;<br />
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br />
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br />
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,<br />
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.</p>

WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. 3, 1802</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Earth</span> has not
anything to show more fair:<br />
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br />
A sight so touching in its majesty:<br />
This city now doth like a garment wear<br />
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,<br />
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br />
Open unto the fields, and to the sky,&mdash;<br />
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.<br />
Never did sun more beautifully steep<br />
In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill;<br />
Ne&rsquo;er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br />
The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br />
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br />
And all that mighty heart is lying still!</p>
<h3>WHEN I HAVE BORNE IN MEMORY</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> I have borne in
memory what has tamed<br />
Great nations; how ennobling thoughts depart,<br />
What men change swords for ledgers, and desert<br />
The student&rsquo;s bower for gold,&mdash;some fears unnamed<br
/>
I had, my country!&mdash;am I to be blamed?<br />
Now, when I think of thee, and what thou art,<br />
Verily, in the bottom of my heart<br />
Of those unfilial fears I am ashamed.<br />
For dearly must we prize thee; we do find<br />
In thee a bulwark for the cause of men;<br />
And I by my affection was beguiled:<br />
What wonder if a Poet now and then,<br />
Among the many movements of his mind,<br />
Felt for thee as a lover or a child!</p>

231</span>THREE YEARS SHE GREW</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Three</span> years she grew
in sun and shower;<br />
Then Nature said, &lsquo;A lovelier flower<br />
On earth was never sown.<br />
This child I to myself will take:<br />
She shall be mine, and I will make<br />
A lady of my own.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Myself will to my darling be<br />
Both law and impulse; and with me<br />
The girl, in rock and plain,<br />
In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,<br />
Shall feel an overseeing power<br />
To kindle or restrain.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;She shall be sportive as the fawn,<br />
That wild with glee across the lawn<br />
Or up the mountain springs;<br />
And hers shall be the breathing balm,<br />
And hers the silence and the calm<br />
Of mute insensate things.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The floating clouds their state shall
lend<br />
To her; for her the willow bend;<br />
Nor shall she fail to see<br />
Ev&rsquo;n in the motions of the storm<br />
Grace that shall mould the maiden&rsquo;s form<br />
By silent sympathy.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&lsquo;The stars of midnight shall be dear<br />
To her, and she shall lean her ear<br />
In many a secret place,<br />
Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br />
And beauty born of murmuring sound<br />
Shall pass into her face.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And vital feelings of delight<br />
Shall rear her form to stately height,<br />
Her virgin bosom swell;<br />
Such thoughts to Lucy I will give<br />
While she and I together live<br />
Here in this happy dell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus Nature spake.&nbsp; The work was
done&mdash;<br />
How soon my Lucy&rsquo;s race was run!<br />
She died, and left to me<br />
This heath, this calm and quiet scene;<br />
The memory of what has been,<br />
And never more will be.</p>
<h3>THE DAFFODILS</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">wandered</span> lonely as
a cloud<br />
That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host of golden daffodils,<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
They stretched in never-ending line<br />
Along the margin of a bay:<br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
<p class="poetry">The waves beside them danced, but they<br />
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:&mdash;<br />
A Poet could not but be gay<br />
In such a jocund company!<br />
I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought<br />
What wealth the show to me had brought;</p>
<p class="poetry">For oft when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
And dances with the daffodils.</p>
<h3>THE SOLITARY REAPER</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Behold</span> her, single
in the field,<br />
Yon solitary Highland Lass!<br />
Reaping and singing by herself;<br />
Stop here, or gently pass!<br />
Alone she cuts and binds the grain<br />
And sings a melancholy strain;<br />
O listen! for the vale profound<br />
Is overflowing with the sound.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>No nightingale did ever chaunt<br />
More welcome notes to weary bands<br />
Of travellers in some shady haunt,<br />
Among Arabian sands:<br />
A voice so thrilling ne&rsquo;er was heard<br />
In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,<br />
Breaking the silence of the seas<br />
Among the farthest Hebrides.</p>
<p class="poetry">Will no one tell me what she sings?<br />
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
And battles long ago:<br />
Or is it some more humble lay,<br />
Familiar matter of to-day?<br />
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br />
That has been and may be again?</p>
<p class="poetry">Whate&rsquo;er the theme, the maiden sang<br />
As if her song could have no ending;<br />
I saw her singing at her work,<br />
And o&rsquo;er the sickle bending;&mdash;<br />
I listened, motionless and still;<br />
And, as I mounted up the hill,<br />
The music in my heart I bore<br />
Long after it was heard no more.</p>
<h3>ELEGIAC STANZAS</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Suggested by a Picture of Peele
Castle in a Storm</i></p>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">was</span> thy neighbour
once, thou rugged pile!<br />
Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:<br />
I saw thee every day; and all the while<br />
Thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!<br />
So like, so very like, was day to day!<br />
Whene&rsquo;er I looked, thy image still was there;<br />
It trembled, but it never passed away.</p>
<p class="poetry">How perfect was the calm!&nbsp; It seemed no
sleep,<br />
No mood, which season takes away or brings:<br />
I could have fancied that the mighty Deep<br />
Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! then&mdash;if mine had been the
painter&rsquo;s hand<br />
To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,<br />
The light that never was on sea or land,<br />
The consecration, and the Poet&rsquo;s dream,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">I would have planted thee, thou hoary pile,<br
/>
Amid a world how different from this!<br />
Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;<br />
On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house
divine<br />
Of peaceful years: a chronicle of heaven;&mdash;<br />
Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine<br />
The very sweetest had to thee been given.</p>
<p class="poetry">A picture had it been of lasting ease,<br />
Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;<br />
No motion but the moving tide; a breeze;<br />
Or merely silent Nature&rsquo;s breathing life.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,<br />
Such picture would I at that time have made;<br />
And seen the soul of truth in every part,<br />
A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>So once it would have been&mdash;&rsquo;tis so no
more;<br />
I have submitted to a new control:<br />
A power is gone which nothing can restore;<br />
A deep distress hath humanized my soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not for a moment could I now behold<br />
A smiling sea, and be what I have been;<br />
The feeling of my loss will ne&rsquo;er be old;<br />
This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the
friend<br />
If he had lived, of him whom I deplore.<br />
This work of thine I blame not, but commend;<br />
This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.</p>
<p class="poetry">O &rsquo;tis a passionate work!&mdash;yet wise
and well,<br />
Well chosen is the spirit that is here;<br />
That hulk which labours in the deadly swell,<br />
This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!</p>
<p class="poetry">And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,<br
/>
I love to see the look with which it braves,&mdash;<br />
Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time&mdash;<br />
The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves.</p>
<p class="poetry">Farewell, farewell the heart that lives
alone,<br />
Housed in a dream, at distance from the kind!<br />
Such happiness, wherever it be known,<br />
Is to be pitied, for &rsquo;tis surely blind.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,<br />
And frequent sights of what is to be borne,&mdash;<br />
Such sights, or worse, as are before me here!<br />
Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.</p>
<h3>TO H. C.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Hartley Coleridge</i>; <i>six
years old</i>.)</p>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">thou</span>! whose
fancies from afar are brought;<br />
Who of thy words dost make a mock apparel,<br />
And fittest to unutterable thought<br />
The breeze-like motion and the self-born carol;<br />
Thou fairy voyager! that dost float<br />
In such clear water that thy boat<br />
May rather seem<br />
To brood on air than on an earthly stream;<br />
Suspended in a stream as clear as sky,<br />
Where earth and heaven do make one imagery;<br />
O blessed vision!&nbsp; O happy child!<br />
That art so exquisitely wild,<br />
I think of thee with many fears<br />
For what may be thy lot in future years.</p>
<p class="poetry">I thought of times when pain might be thy
guest,<br />
Lord of thy house and hospitality;<br />
And grief, uneasy lover! never rest<br />
But when she sat within the touch of thee.<br />
O! too industrious folly!<br />
O! vain and causeless melancholy!<br />
Nature will either end thee quite;<br />
Or, lengthening out thy season of delight,<br />
Preserve for thee, by individual right,<br />
A young lamb&rsquo;s heart among the full-grown flocks.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>What hast thou to do with sorrow,<br />
Or the injuries of to-morrow?<br />
Thou art a dew-drop which the morn brings forth,<br />
Not framed to undergo unkindly shocks;<br />
Or to be trailed along the soiling earth;<br />
A gem that glitters while it lives,<br />
And no forewarning gives;<br />
But, at the touch of wrong, without a strife<br />
Slips in a moment out of life.</p>
<h3>&rsquo;TIS SAID THAT SOME HAVE DIED FOR LOVE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">&rsquo;Tis</span> said that
some have died for love:<br />
And here and there a churchyard grave is found<br />
In the cold North&rsquo;s unhallowed ground,<br />
Because the wretched man himself had slain,&mdash;<br />
His love was such a grievous pain.<br />
And there is one whom I five years have known;<br />
He dwells alone<br />
Upon Helvellyn&rsquo;s side:<br />
He loved&mdash;the pretty Barbara died,<br />
And thus he makes his moan:<br />
Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid,<br />
When thus his moan he made:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O move, thou cottage, from behind that
oak!<br />
Or let the aged tree uprooted lie,<br />
That in some other way yon smoke<br />
May mount into the sky!<br />
The clouds pass on; they from the heavens depart:<br />
I look&mdash;the sky is empty space;<br />
I know not what I trace;<br />
But, when I cease to look, my hand is on my heart.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&lsquo;O what a weight is in these shades!&nbsp; Ye
leaves,<br />
When will that dying murmur be suppressed?<br />
Your sound my heart of peace bereaves,<br />
It robs my heart of rest.<br />
Thou thrush, that singest loud&mdash;and loud and free,<br />
Into yon row of willows flit,<br />
Upon that alder sit;<br />
Or sing another song, or choose another tree.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Roll back, sweet rill! back to thy
mountain bounds,<br />
And there for ever be thy waters chained!<br />
For thou dost haunt the air with sounds<br />
That cannot be sustained;<br />
If still beneath that pine-tree&rsquo;s ragged bough<br />
Headlong yon waterfall must come,<br />
O let it then be dumb!&mdash;<br />
Be anything, sweet rill, but that which thou art now.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thou eglantine, whose arch so proudly
towers<br />
(Even like a rainbow spanning half the vale),<br />
Thou one fair shrub&mdash;oh, shed thy flowers,<br />
And stir not in the gale!<br />
For thus to see thee nodding in the air,&mdash;<br />
To see thy arch thus stretch and bend,<br />
Thus rise and thus descend,&mdash;<br />
Disturbs me, till the sight is more than I can bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The man who makes this feverish complaint<br />
Is one of giant stature, who could dance<br />
Equipped from head to foot in iron mail.<br />
Ah gentle love! if ever thought was thine<br />
To store up kindred hours for me, thy face<br />
Turn from me, gentle love! nor let me walk<br />
Within the sound of Emma&rsquo;s voice, or know<br />
Such happiness as I have known to-day.</p>
<h3><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>THE
PET LAMB</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A Pastoral</i></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> dew was falling
fast, the stars began to blink;<br />
I heard a voice: it said, &lsquo;Drink, pretty creature,
drink!&rsquo;<br />
And, looking o&rsquo;er the hedge, before me I espied<br />
A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.</p>
<p class="poetry">No other sheep were near, the lamb was all
alone,<br />
And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;<br />
With one knee on the grass did the little maiden kneel,<br />
While to that mountain lamb she gave its evening meal.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lamb, while from her hand he thus his
supper took,<br />
Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure
shook.<br />
&lsquo;Drink, pretty creature, drink,&rsquo; she said, in such a
tone<br />
That I almost received her heart into my own.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child
of beauty rare!<br />
I watched them with delight; they were a lovely pair.<br />
Now with her empty can the maiden turned away;<br />
But ere ten yards were gone, her footsteps did she stay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Towards the lamb she looked; and from that
shady place<br />
I, unobserved, could see the workings of her face;<br />
If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,<br />
Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little maid might
sing:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&lsquo;What ails thee, young one?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Why
pull so at thy cord?<br />
Is it not well with thee?&nbsp; Well both for bed and board?<br

Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;<br />
Rest, little young one, rest; what is&rsquo;t that aileth
thee?</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;What is it thou wouldst seek?&nbsp; What

And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If the sun be shining hot, do but
stretch thy woollen chain,<br />
This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain;<br />
For rain and mountain storms, the like thou need&rsquo;st not
fear;&mdash;<br />
The rain and storm are things which scarcely can come here.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Rest, little young one, rest; thou hast
forgot the day<br />
When my father found thee first in places far away:<br />
Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none;<br />
And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;He took thee in his arms, and in pity
brought thee home:<br />
A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?<br />
A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean<br />

Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;<br />
And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,<br />
I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is, and new.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout
as they are now,<br />
Then I&rsquo;ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the
plough;<br />
My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is cold,<br />
Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;It will not, will not rest!&mdash;poor
creature, can it be<br />
That &rsquo;tis thy mother&rsquo;s heart which is working so in
thee?<br />
Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear,<br />
And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Alas, the mountain-tops that look so
green and fair!<br />
I&rsquo;ve heard of fearful winds and darkness that come
there;<br />
The little brooks, that seem all pastime and all play,<br />
When they are angry roar like lions for their prey.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Here thou need&rsquo;st not dread the
raven in the sky;<br />
Night and day thou art safe,&mdash;our cottage is hard by.<br />
Why bleat so after me?&nbsp; Why pull so at thy chain?<br />
Sleep&mdash;and at break of day I will come to thee
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">As homeward through the lane I went with lazy
feet,<br />
This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat;<br />
And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line,<br />
That but half of it was hers, and one-half of it was mine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>Again, and once again did I repeat the song;<br />
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;more than half to the damsel

That I almost received her heart into my own.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>STEPPING WESTWARD</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>While my fellow-traveller and I
were walking by the side of Loch Katrine</i>, <i>one fine evening
after sunset</i>, <i>in our road to a hut where in the course of
our tour we had been hospitably entertained some weeks
before</i>, <i>we met</i>, <i>in one of the loneliest parts of
that solitary region</i>, <i>two well-dressed women</i>, <i>one
of whom said to us</i>, <i>by way of greeting</i>,
&lsquo;<i>What</i>, <i>you are stepping westward</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<i>What</i>, <i>you are stepping
westward</i>?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Yea</i>.&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;&rsquo;Twould be a wildish destiny,<br />
If we, who thus together roam<br />
In a strange land, and far from home,<br />
Were in this place the guests of chance;<br />
Yet who would stop, or fear t&rsquo; advance,<br />
Though home or shelter he had none,<br />
With such a sky to lead him on?</p>
<p class="poetry">The dewy ground was dark and cold;<br />
Behind, all gloomy to behold;<br />
And stepping westward seemed to be<br />
A kind of heavenly destiny:<br />
I liked the greeting; &rsquo;twas a sound<br />
Of something without place or bound;<br />
And seemed to give me spiritual right<br />
To travel through that region bright.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>The voice was soft, and she who spake<br />
Was walking by her native lake;<br />
The salutation had to me<br />
The very sound of courtesy;<br />
Its power was felt; and while my eye<br />
Was fixed upon the glowing sky,<br />
The echo of the voice enwrought<br />
A human sweetness with the thought<br />
Of travelling through the world that lay<br />
Before me in my endless way.</p>
<h3>THE CHILDLESS FATHER</h3>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Up</span>, Timothy,
up with your staff and away!<br />
Not a soul in the village this morning will stay;<br />
The hare has just started from Hamilton&rsquo;s grounds,<br />
And Skiddaw is glad with the cry of the hounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Of coats and of jackets grey, scarlet,
and green,<br />
On the slopes of the pastures all colours were seen;<br />
With their comely blue aprons, and caps white as snow,<br />
The girls on the hills made a holiday show.</p>
<p class="poetry">The basin of boxwood, <a
name="citation244"></a><a href="#footnote244"
class="citation">[244]</a> just six months before,<br />
Had stood on the table at Timothy&rsquo;s door;<br />
A coffin through Timothy&rsquo;s threshold had passed;<br />
One child did it bear, and that child was his last.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>Now fast up the dell came the noise and the fray,<br />
The horse and the horn, and the &lsquo;hark! hark away!&rsquo;<br
/>
Old Timothy took up his staff, and he shut,<br />
With a leisurely motion, the door of his hut.</p>
<p class="poetry">Perhaps to himself at that moment he said,<br
/>
&lsquo;The key I must take, for my Helen is dead.&rsquo;<br />
But of this in my ears not a word did he speak,<br />
And he went to the chase with a tear on his cheek.</p>

To live beneath your more habitual sway:<br />
I love the brooks which down their channels fret<br />
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;<br />
The innocent brightness of a new-born day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is lovely
yet;<br />
The clouds that gather round the setting sun<br />
Do take a sober colouring from an eye<br />
That hath kept watch o&rsquo;er man&rsquo;s mortality;<br />
Another race hath been, and other palms are won.<br />
Thanks to the human heart by which we live,<br />
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,<br />
To me the meanest flower that blows can give<br />
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.</p>

A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br />
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br />
Through caverns measureless to man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down to a sunless sea.<br />
So twice five miles of fertile ground<br />
With walls and towers were girdled round:<br />
<a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>And
there were gardens bright with sinuous rills<br />
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br />

Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br />
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br />
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher&rsquo;s flail;<br />
And &rsquo;mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br />

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br />
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br />

Ancestral voices prophesying war!</p>

That with music loud and long<br />
I would build that dome in air,<br />
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br />
And all who heard should see them there,<br />
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br />

That Youth and I are house-mates still.<br />
Dew-drops are the gems of morning,<br />

That only serves to make us grieve,<br />

When we are old:<br />
That only serves to make us grieve<br />
With oft and tedious taking-leave,<br />
Like some poor nigh-related guest<br />
That may not rudely be dismissed,<br />
Yet hath out-stayed his welcome while,<br />
And tells the jest without the smile.</p>

259</span>&lsquo;The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br />
Merrily did we drop<br />
Below the kirk, below the hill,<br />
Below the lighthouse top.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The sun came up upon the left,<br />
Out of the sea came he!<br />
And he shone bright, and on the right<br />
Went down into the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Higher and higher every day,<br />
Till over the mast at noon&mdash;&rsquo;<br />
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br />
For he heard the loud bassoon.</p>
<p class="poetry">The bride hath paced into the hall,<br />
Bed as a rose is she;<br />
Nodding their heads before her goes<br />
The merry minstrelsy.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br />
Yet he cannot choose but hear;<br />
And thus spake on that ancient man,<br />
The bright-eyed Mariner.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And now the Storm-blast came, and he<br
/>
Was tyrannous and strong:<br />
He struck with his o&rsquo;ertaking wings,<br />
And chased us south along.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;With sloping masts and dipping prow<br
/>
As who pursued with yell and blow<br />
Still treads the shadow of his foe,<br />
<a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>And
forward bends his head,<br />
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<br />
And southward aye we fled.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And now there came both mist and
snow,<br />
And it grew wondrous cold:<br />
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br />
As green as emerald.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And through the drifts the snowy
clifts<br />
Did send a dismal sheen:<br />
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken&mdash;<br />
The ice was all between.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The ice was here, the ice was there,<br
/>
The ice was all around:<br />
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br />
Like noises in a swound!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;At length did cross an Albatross,<br />
Thorough the fog it came;<br />
As it had been a Christian soul,<br />
We hailed it in God&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;It ate the food it ne&rsquo;er had
eat,<br />
And round and round it flew.<br />
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br />
The helmsman steered us through!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And a good south wind sprang up
behind;<br />
The Albatross did follow,<br />
And every day, for food or play,<br />
Came to the mariner&rsquo;s hollo!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>&lsquo;In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br />
It perched for vespers nine;<br />
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br />
Glimmered the white moon-shine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;God save thee, ancient Mariner!<br />
From the fiends that plague thee thus!&mdash;<br />
Why look&rsquo;st thou so?&rsquo;&mdash;With my cross-bow<br />
I shot the Albatross.</p>
<h4>PART II</h4>
<p class="poetry">The sun now rose upon the right:<br />
Out of the sea came he,<br />
Still hid in mist, and on the left<br />
Went down into the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the good south wind still blew behind,<br
/>
But no sweet bird did follow,<br />
Nor any day for food or play<br />
Came to the mariner&rsquo;s hollo!</p>
<p class="poetry">And I had done a hellish thing,<br />
And it would work &rsquo;em woe:<br />
For all averred I had killed the bird<br />
That made the breeze to blow.<br />
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,<br />
That made the breeze to blow!</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor dim nor red, like God&rsquo;s own head<br
/>
The glorious Sun uprist:<br />
Then all averred I had killed the bird<br />
That brought the fog and mist.<br />
&rsquo;Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,<br />
That bring the fog and mist.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,<br />
The furrow followed free;<br />
We were the first that ever burst<br />
Into that silent sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,<br
/>
&rsquo;Twas sad as sad could be;<br />
And we did speak only to break<br />
The silence of the sea!</p>
<p class="poetry">All in a hot and copper sky,<br />
The bloody Sun, at noon,<br />
Right up above the mast did stand,<br />
No bigger than the Moon.</p>
<p class="poetry">Day after day, day after day,<br />
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;<br />
As idle as a painted ship<br />
Upon a painted ocean.</p>
<p class="poetry">Water, water, every where,<br />
And all the boards did shrink;<br />
Water, water, every where<br />
Nor any drop to drink.</p>
<p class="poetry">The very deep did rot: O Christ!<br />
That ever this should be!<br />
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<br />
Upon the slimy sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">About, about, in reel and rout<br />
The death-fires danced at night;<br />
The water, like a witch&rsquo;s oils,<br />
Burnt green, and blue and white.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>And some in dreams assured were<br />
Of the Spirit that plagued us so,<br />
Nine fathom deep he had followed us<br />
From the land of mist and snow.</p>
<p class="poetry">And every tongue, through utter drought,<br />
Was withered at the root;<br />
We could not speak, no more than if<br />
We had been choked with soot.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! well a-day! what evil looks<br />
Had I from old and young!<br />
Instead of the cross, the Albatross<br />
About my neck was hung.</p>
<h4>PART III</h4>
<p class="poetry">There passed a weary time.&nbsp; Each throat<br
/>
Was parched, and glazed each eye.<br />
A weary time! a weary time!<br />
How glazed each weary eye&mdash;<br />
When looking westward, I beheld<br />
A something in the sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">At first it seemed a little speck,<br />
And then it seemed a mist;<br />
It moved and moved, and took at last<br />
A certain shape, I wist.</p>
<p class="poetry">A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!<br />
And still it neared and neared:<br />
As if it dodged a water-sprite,<br />
It plunged and tacked and veered.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<br />
We could nor laugh nor wail;<br />
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!<br />
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,<br />
And cried, A sail! a sail!</p>
<p class="poetry">With throats unslaked, with black lips
baked,<br />
Agape they heard me call:<br />
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,<br />
And all at once their breath drew in,<br />
As they were drinking all.</p>
<p class="poetry">See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!<br />
Hither to work us weal,<br />
Without a breeze, without a tide,<br />
She steadies with upright keel!</p>
<p class="poetry">The western wave was all aflame,<br />
The day was well nigh done;<br />
Almost upon the western wave<br />
Rested the broad bright Sun;<br />
When that strange shape drove suddenly<br />
Betwixt us and the Sun!</p>
<p class="poetry">And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,<br
/>
(Heaven&rsquo;s Mother send us grace!)<br />
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered<br />
With broad and burning face.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)<br />
How fast she nears and nears!<br />
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,<br />
Like restless gossameres?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>Are those her ribs through which the Sun<br />
Did peer as through a grate?<br />
And is that Woman all her crew?<br />
Is that a Death? and are there two?<br />
Is Death that woman&rsquo;s mate?</p>
<p class="poetry">Her lips were red, her looks were free,<br />
Her locks were yellow as gold,<br />
Her skin was white as leprosy;<br />
The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,<br />
Who thicks man&rsquo;s blood with cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">The naked hulk alongside came,<br />
And the twain were casting dice;<br />
&lsquo;The game is done!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve won!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
won!&rsquo;<br />
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Sun&rsquo;s rim dips; the stars rush
out:<br />
At one stride comes the dark;<br />
With far-heard whisper, o&rsquo;er the sea,<br />
Off shot the spectre-bark.</p>
<p class="poetry">We listened and looked sideways up;<br />
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,<br />
My life-blood seemed to sip!<br />
The stars were dim, and thick the night,<br />
The steersman&rsquo;s face by his lamp gleamed white;<br />
From the sails the dew did drip&mdash;<br />
Till clomb above the eastern bar<br />
The horned Moon, with one bright star<br />
Within the nether tip.</p>
<p class="poetry">One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,<br />
Too quick for groan or sigh,<br />
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,<br />
And cursed me with his eye.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>Four times fifty living men,<br />
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)<br />
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,<br />
They dropped down one by one.</p>
<p class="poetry">The souls did from their bodies fly,&mdash;<br
/>
They fled to bliss or woe!<br />
And every soul it passed me by,<br />
Like the whizz of my cross-bow!</p>
<h4>PART IV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I fear thee, ancient Mariner!<br />
I fear thy skinny hand!<br />
And thou art long, and lank, and brown,<br />
As is the ribbed sea-sand.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I fear thee and thy glittering eye,<br
/>
And thy skinny hand so brown.&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!<br />
This body dropt not down.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alone, alone, all, all alone,<br />
Alone on a wide wide sea!<br />
And never a saint took pity on<br />
My soul in agony.</p>
<p class="poetry">The many men, so beautiful!<br />
And they all dead did lie;<br />
And a thousand thousand slimy things<br />
Lived on; and so did I.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>I looked upon the rotting sea,<br />
And drew mine eyes away:<br />
I looked upon the rotting deck,<br />
And there the dead men lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">I looked to heaven and tried to pray;<br />
But or ever a prayer had gusht,<br />
A wicked whisper came and made<br />
My heart as dry as dust.</p>
<p class="poetry">I closed my lids, and kept them close,<br />
And the balls like pulses beat;<br />
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky<br />
Lay like a load on my weary eye,<br />
And the dead were at my feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cold sweat melted from their limbs,<br />
Nor rot nor reek did they:<br />
The look with which they looked on me<br />
Had never passed away.</p>
<p class="poetry">An orphan&rsquo;s curse would drag to hell<br
/>
A spirit from on high;<br />
But oh! more horrible than that<br />
Is the curse in a dead man&rsquo;s eye!<br />
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,<br />
And yet I could not die.</p>
<p class="poetry">The moving Moon went up the sky,<br />
And nowhere did abide:<br />
Softly she was going up,<br />
And a star or two beside&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>Her beams bemocked the sultry main,<br />
Like April hoar-frost spread;<br />
But where the ship&rsquo;s huge shadow lay,<br />
The charmed water burnt alway<br />
A still and awful red.</p>
<p class="poetry">Beyond the shadow of the ship,<br />
I watched the water-snakes:<br />
They moved in tracks of shining white,<br />
And when they reared, the elfish light<br />
Fell off in hoary flakes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Within the shadow of the ship<br />
I watched their rich attire:<br />
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,<br />
They coiled and swam: and every track<br />
Was a flash of golden fire.</p>
<p class="poetry">O happy living things! no tongue<br />
Their beauty might declare;<br />
A spring of love gushed from my heart,<br />
And I blessed them unaware:<br />
Sure my kind Saint took pity on me,<br />
And I blessed them unaware.</p>
<p class="poetry">The selfsame moment I could pray;<br />
And from my neck so free<br />
The Albatross fell off, and sank<br />
Like lead into the sea.</p>
<h4>PART V</h4>
<p class="poetry">O sleep! it is a gentle thing,<br />
Beloved from pole to pole!<br />
<a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>To Mary
Queen the praise be given!<br />
She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,<br />
That slid into my soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">The silly buckets on the deck,<br />
That had so long remained,<br />
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;<br />
And when I woke, it rained.</p>
<p class="poetry">My lips were wet, my throat was cold,<br />
My garments all were dank;<br />
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,<br />
And still my body drank.</p>
<p class="poetry">I moved, and could not feel my limbs;<br />
I was so light&mdash;almost<br />
I thought that I had died in sleep,<br />
And was a blessed ghost.</p>
<p class="poetry">And soon I heard a roaring wind:<br />
It did not come anear;<br />
But with its sound it shook the sails,<br />
That were so thin and sere.</p>
<p class="poetry">The upper air burst into life!<br />
And a hundred fire-flags sheen,<br />
To and fro they were hurried about!<br />
And to and fro, and in and out,<br />
The wan stars danced between.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the coming wind did roar more loud,<br />
And the sails did sigh like sedge;<br />
And the rain poured down from one black cloud;<br />
The Moon was at its edge.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>The thick black cloud was cleft, and still<br />
The Moon was at its side:<br />
Like waters shot from some high crag,<br />
The lightning fell with never a jag,<br />
A river steep and wide.</p>
<p class="poetry">The loud wind never reached the ship,<br />
Yet now the ship moved on!<br />
Beneath the lightning and the Moon<br />
The dead men gave a groan.</p>
<p class="poetry">They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,<br
/>
Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;<br />
It had been strange, even in a dream,<br />
To have seen those dead men rise.</p>
<p class="poetry">The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;<br />
Yet never a breeze up blew;<br />
The mariners all &rsquo;gan work the ropes,<br />
Where they were wont to do;<br />
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools&mdash;<br />
We were a ghastly crew.</p>
<p class="poetry">The body of my brother&rsquo;s son<br />
Stood by me, knee to knee:<br />
The body and I pulled at one rope<br />
But he said nought to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I fear thee, ancient Mariner!&rsquo;<br
/>
Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!<br />
&rsquo;Twas not those souls that fled in pain,<br />
Which to their corses came again,<br />
But a troop of spirits blest:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>For when it dawned&mdash;they dropped their arms,<br />
And clustered round the mast;<br />
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<br />
And from their bodies passed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<br />
Then darted to the Sun;<br />
Slowly the sounds came back again,<br />
Now mixed, now one by one.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sometimes a-dropping from the sky<br />
I heard the sky-lark sing;<br />
Sometimes all little birds that are,<br />
How they seemed to fill the sea and air<br />
With their sweet jargoning!</p>
<p class="poetry">And now &rsquo;twas like all instruments,<br />
Now like a lonely flute;<br />
And now it is an angel&rsquo;s song,<br />
That makes the heavens be mute.</p>
<p class="poetry">It ceased; yet still the sails made on<br />
A pleasant noise till noon,<br />
A noise like of a hidden brook<br />
In the leafy month of June,<br />
That to the sleeping woods all night<br />
Singeth a quiet tune.</p>
<p class="poetry">Till noon we quietly sailed on,<br />
Yet never a breeze did breathe;<br />
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,<br />
Moved onward from beneath.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>Under the keel nine fathom deep,<br />
From the land of mist and snow,<br />
The spirit slid: and it was he<br />
That made the ship to go.<br />
The sails at noon left off their tune,<br />
And the ship stood still also.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Sun, right up above the mast,<br />
Had fixed her to the ocean:<br />
But in a minute she &rsquo;gan stir,<br />
With a short uneasy motion&mdash;<br />
Backwards and forwards half her length<br />
With a short uneasy motion.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then like a pawing horse let go,<br />
She made a sudden bound:<br />
It flung the blood into my head,<br />
And I fell down in a swound.</p>
<p class="poetry">How long in that same fit I lay,<br />
I have not to declare;<br />
But ere my living life returned,<br />
I heard, and in my soul discerned,<br />
Two voices in the air.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Is it he?&rsquo; quoth one, &lsquo;Is
this the man?<br />
By Him who died on cross,<br />
With his cruel bow he laid full low<br />
The harmless Albatross.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The spirit who bideth by himself<br />
In the land of mist and snow,<br />
He loved the bird that loved the man<br />
Who shot him with his bow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>The other was a softer voice,<br />
As soft as honey-dew:<br />
Quoth he, &lsquo;The man hath penance done,<br />
And penance more will do.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>PART VI</h4>
<p style="text-align: center">FIRST VOICE</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But tell me, tell me! speak again,<br />
Thy soft response renewing&mdash;<br />
What makes that ship drive on so fast?<br />
What is the ocean doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SECOND VOICE</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Still as a slave before his lord,<br />
The ocean hath no blast;<br />
His great bright eye most silently<br />
Up to the moon is cast&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If he may know which way to go;<br />
For she guides him smooth or grim.<br />
See, brother, see! how graciously<br />
She looketh down on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">FIRST VOICE</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But why drives on that ship so fast,<br
/>
Without or wave or wind?&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SECOND VOICE</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The air is cut away before,<br />
And closes from behind.<br />
<a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&lsquo;Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!<br />
Or we shall be belated:<br />
For slow and slow that ship will go,<br />
When the Mariner&rsquo;s trance is abated.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I woke, and we were sailing on<br />
As in a gentle weather:<br />
&rsquo;Twas night, calm night, the moon was high,<br />
The dead men stood together.</p>
<p class="poetry">All stood together on the deck,<br />
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:<br />
All fixed on me their stony eyes,<br />
That in the Moon did glitter.</p>
<p class="poetry">The pang, the curse, with which they died<br />
Had never passed away;<br />
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,<br />
Nor turn them up to pray.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now this spell was snapt: once more<br />
I viewed the ocean green,<br />
And looked far forth, yet little saw<br />
Of what had else been seen&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Like one that on a lonesome road<br />
Doth walk in fear and dread,<br />
And having once turned round walks on,<br />
And turns no more his head;<br />
Because he knows a frightful fiend<br />
Doth close behind him tread.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>But soon there breathed a wind on me,<br />
Nor sound nor motion made:<br />
Its path was not upon the sea,<br />
In ripple or in shade.</p>
<p class="poetry">It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek<br />
Like a meadow-gale of spring&mdash;<br />
It mingled strangely with my fears,<br />
Yet it felt like a welcoming.</p>
<p class="poetry">Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,<br />
Yet she sailed softly too;<br />
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze&mdash;<br />
On me alone it blew.</p>
<p class="poetry">O! dream of joy! is this indeed<br />
The lighthouse top I see?<br />
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?<br />
Is this mine own countree?</p>
<p class="poetry">We drifted o&rsquo;er the harbour bar,<br />
And I with sobs did pray&mdash;<br />
O let me be awake, my God!<br />
Or let me sleep alway.</p>
<p class="poetry">The harbour-bay was clear as glass,<br />
So smoothly it was strewn!<br />
And on the bay the moonlight lay,<br />
And the shadow of the Moon.</p>
<p class="poetry">The rock shone bright, the kirk no less<br />
That stands above the rock:<br />
The moonlight steeped in silentness<br />
The steady weathercock.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>And the bay was white with silent light,<br />
Till, rising from the same,<br />
Full many shapes, that shadows were,<br />
In crimson colours came.</p>
<p class="poetry">A little distance from the prow<br />
Those crimson shadows were:<br />
I turned my eyes upon the deck&mdash;<br />
O, Christ! what saw I there!</p>
<p class="poetry">Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,<br />
And, by the holy rood!<br />
A man all light, a seraph-man,<br />
On every corse there stood.</p>
<p class="poetry">This seraph-band, each waved his hand:<br />
It was a heavenly sight!<br />
They stood as signals to the land,<br />
Each one a lovely light;</p>
<p class="poetry">This seraph-band, each waved his hand,<br />
No voice did they impart&mdash;<br />
No voice; but oh! the silence sank<br />
Like music on my heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">But soon I heard the dash of oars,<br />
I heard the Pilot&rsquo;s cheer;<br />
My head was turned perforce away,<br />
And I saw a boat appear.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Pilot and the Pilot&rsquo;s boy,<br />
I heard them coming fast:<br />
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy<br />
The dead men could not blast.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>I saw a third&mdash;I heard his voice:<br />
It is the hermit good!<br />
He singeth loud his godly hymns<br />
That he makes in the wood.<br />
He&rsquo;ll shrieve my soul, he&rsquo;ll wash away<br />
The Albatross&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<h4>PART VII</h4>
<p class="poetry">This Hermit good lives in that wood<br />
Which slopes down to the sea.<br />
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!<br />
He loves to talk with marineres<br />
That come from a far countree.</p>
<p class="poetry">He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve,&mdash;<br
/>
He hath a cushion plump:<br />
It is the moss that wholly hides<br />
The rotted old oak-stump.</p>
<p class="poetry">The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk:<br />
&lsquo;Why, this is strange, I trow!<br />
Where are those lights, so many and fair,<br />
That signal made but now?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Strange, by my faith!&rsquo; the Hermit
said&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;And they answered not our cheer!<br />
The planks looked warped! and see those sails,<br />
How thin they are and sere!<br />
I never saw aught like to them,<br />
Unless perchance it were<br />
<a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>Brown
skeletons of leaves that lag<br />
My forest-brook along;<br />
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,<br />
And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,<br />
That eats the she-wolf&rsquo;s young.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish
look&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
(The Pilot made reply)<br />
&lsquo;I am a-feared&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Push on, push
on!&rsquo;<br />
Said the Hermit cheerily.</p>
<p class="poetry">The boat came closer to the ship,<br />
But I nor spake nor stirred;<br />
The boat came close beneath the ship,<br />
And straight a sound was heard.</p>
<p class="poetry">Under the water it rumbled on,<br />
Still louder and more dread;<br />
It reached the ship, it split the bay;<br />
The ship went down like lead.</p>
<p class="poetry">Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,<br />
Which sky and ocean smote,<br />
Like one that hath been seven days drowned<br />
My body lay afloat;<br />
But swift as dreams, myself I found<br />
Within the Pilot&rsquo;s boat.</p>
<p class="poetry">Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,<br />
The boat spun round and round;<br />

With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Its a&euml;rial hue<br />

deflowered,<br />

Till the scent it gives<br />

Praise of love or wine<br />

<p

hymeneal<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

thine, would be all<br />

THE MOON</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Art</span> thou pale for weariness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of climbing heaven, and gazing on the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wandering companionless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the stars that have a different
birth,&mdash;<br />
And ever-changing, like a joyless eye<br />
That finds no object worth its constancy?</p>
<h3>THE QUESTION</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">dreamed</span> that as I
wandered by the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,<br />
And gentle odours led my steps astray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring<br />
Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling<br />
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,<br />
But kissed it and then fled, as Thou mightest in dream.</p>
<p class="poetry">There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,<br />
The constellated flower that never sets;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faint oxlips; tender blue-bells, at whose birth<br
/>
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets<br />
Its mother&rsquo;s face with heaven-collected tears,<br />
When the low wind, its playmate&rsquo;s voice, it hears.</p>
<p class="poetry">And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Green cow-bind and the moonlight-coloured May,<br />
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the bright dew yet drained not by the day;<br />
<a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>And wild
roses, and ivy serpentine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;<br
/>
And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,<br />
Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.</p>
<p class="poetry">And nearer to the river&rsquo;s trembling
edge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with
white,<br />
And starry river-buds among the sedge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,<br />
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With moonlight beams of their own watery light;<br
/>
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green<br />
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.</p>
<p class="poetry">Methought that of these visionary flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a nosegay, bound in such a way<br />
That the same hues, which in their natural bowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were mingled or opposed, the like array<br />
Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within my hand,&mdash;and then, elate and gay,<br />
I hastened to the spot whence I had come<br />
That I might there present it&mdash;O! to Whom?</p>
<h3>THE WANING MOON</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">And</span> like a dying
lady, lean and pale,<br />
Who totters forth, wrapt in a gauzy veil,<br />
Out of her chamber, led by the insane<br />
And feeble wanderings of her fading brain,<br />
The moon arose up in the murky east,<br />
A white and shapeless mass.</p>

TO THE WEST WIND</h3>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">wild</span> West Wind,
thou breath of Autumn&rsquo;s being,<br />
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead<br />
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,<br />
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,<br />
Pestilence-stricken multitudes! O thou<br />
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed<br />
The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,<br />
Each like a corpse within its grave, until<br />
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow<br />
Her clarion o&rsquo;er the dreaming earth, and fill<br />
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)<br />
With living hues and odours plain and hill:<br />
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;<br />
Destroyer and Preserver: Hear, oh hear!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou on whose stream,
&rsquo;mid the steep sky&rsquo;s commotion,<br />
Loose clouds like earth&rsquo;s decaying leaves are shed,<br />
Shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean,<br />
Angels of rain and lightning! there are spread<br />
On the blue surface of thine airy surge,<br />
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head<br />
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge<br />
Of the horizon to the zenith&rsquo;s height&mdash;<br />
The locks of the approaching storm.&nbsp; Thou dirge<br />
Of the dying year, to which this closing night<br />
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,<br />
Vaulted with all thy congregated might<br />
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere<br />
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>Thou who didst waken from his
summer-dreams<br />
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,<br />
Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,<br />
Beside a pumice isle in Baiae&rsquo;s bay,<br />
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers<br />
Quivering within the wave&rsquo;s intenser day,<br />
All overgrown with azure moss, and flowers<br />
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them!&nbsp; Thou<br />
For whose path the Atlantic&rsquo;s level powers<br />
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below<br />
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear<br />
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know<br />
Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear<br />
And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were a dead leaf thou
mightest bear;<br />
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;<br />
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share<br />
The impulse of thy strength, only less free<br />
Than Thou, O uncontrollable!&nbsp; If even<br />
I were as in my boyhood, and could be<br />
The comrade of thy wanderings over heaven,<br />
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed<br />
Scarce seemed a vision,&mdash;I would ne&rsquo;er have striven<br
/>
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.<br />
O! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!<br />
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!<br />
A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed<br />
One too like thee&mdash;tameless, and swift, and proud.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make me thy lyre, even as the
forest is:<br />
What if my leaves are falling like its own!<br />
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies<br />
Will take from both a deep autumnal tone,<br />
<a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>Sweet
though in sadness.&nbsp; Be thou, Spirit fierce,<br />
My spirit! be thou me, impetuous one!<br />
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe,<br />
Like withered leaves, to quicken a new birth;<br />
And, by the incantation of this verse,<br />
Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth<br />
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind<br />
Be through my lips to unawakened earth<br />
The trumpet of a prophecy!&nbsp; O Wind,<br />
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?</p>

thee, that thou art not near,<br />

Thou wilt never come for pity,<br />

Those cruel wings, and thou wilt stay.</p>

Which is Nature&rsquo;s, and may be<br />
Untainted by man&rsquo;s misery.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such society<br />
As is quiet, wise and good;<br />

The things I seek, not love them less.</p>

<h3>THE INVITATION, TO JANE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Best</span> and brightest,
come away!<br />
Fairer far than this fair Day,<br />
Which, like thee to those in sorrow,<br />
Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow<br />
To the rough Year just awake<br />
In its cradle on the brake.<br />
The brightest hour of unborn Spring,<br />
Through the winter wandering,<br />
Found, it seems, the halcyon Morn<br />
To hoar February born;<br />
Bending from Heaven, in azure mirth,<br />
It kissed the forehead of the Earth,<br />
And smiled upon the silent sea,<br />
And bade the frozen streams be free,<br />
And waked to music all their fountains,<br />
And breathed upon the frozen mountains,<br />
And like a prophetess of May<br />
Strewed flowers upon the barren way,<br />
Making the wintry world appear<br />
Like one on whom thou smilest, dear.<br />
Away, away, from men and towns,<br />
To the wild wood and the downs&mdash;<br />
To the silent wilderness<br />
Where the soul need not repress<br />
<a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>Its
music, lest it should not find<br />
An echo in another&rsquo;s mind,<br />
While the touch of Nature&rsquo;s art<br />
Harmonizes heart to heart.<br />
I leave this notice on my door<br />
For each accustomed visitor:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;I am gone into the fields<br />
To take what this sweet hour yields;&mdash;<br />
Reflection, you may come to-morrow,<br />
Sit by the fireside with sorrow.&mdash;<br />
You with the unpaid bill, Despair,&mdash;<br />
You tiresome verse-reciter, Care,&mdash;<br />
I will pay you in the grave,&mdash;<br />
Death will listen to your stave.<br />
Expectation, too, be off!<br />
To-day is for itself enough;<br />
Hope in pity mock not Woe<br />
With smiles, nor follow where I go;<br />
Long having lived on thy sweet food,<br />
At length I find one moment&rsquo;s good<br />
After long pain&mdash;with all your love,<br />
This you never told me of.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Radiant sister of the Day,<br />
Awake! arise! and come away!<br />
To the wild woods and the plains,<br />
And the pools where winter rains<br />
Image all their roof of leaves,<br />
Where the pine its garland weaves<br />
Of sapless green and ivy dun<br />
Round stems that never kiss the sun;<br />
Where the lawns and pastures be,<br />
And the sand-hills of the sea;&mdash;<br />
<a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Where
the melting hoar-frost wets<br />
The daisy-star that never sets,<br />
The wind-flowers, and violets,<br />
Which yet join not scent to hue,<br />
Crown the pale year weak and new;<br />
When the night is left behind<br />
In the deep east, dun and blind,<br />
And the blue noon is over us,<br />
And the multitudinous<br />
Billows murmur at our feet,<br />
Where the earth and ocean meet,<br />
And all things seem only one<br />
In the universal sun.</p>
<h3>THE RECOLLECTION</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span> the last day of
many days<br />
All beautiful and bright as thou,<br />
The loveliest and the last, is dead:<br />
Rise, Memory, and write its praise!<br />
Up&mdash;to thy wonted work! come, trace<br />
The epitaph of glory fled,<br />
For now the earth has changed its face,<br />
A frown is on the heaven&rsquo;s brow.</p>
<p class="poetry">We wandered to the Pine Forest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That skirts the Ocean&rsquo;s foam;<br />
The lightest wind was in its nest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tempest in its home.<br />
The whispering waves were half asleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds were gone to play,<br />
And on the bosom of the deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The smile of heaven lay;<br />
<a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>It
seemed as if the hour were one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent from beyond the skies<br />
Which scattered from above the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A light of Paradise!</p>
<p class="poetry">We paused amid the pines that stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The giants of the waste,<br />
Tortured by storms to shapes as rude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As serpents interlaced,&mdash;<br />
And soothed by every azure breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That under heaven is blown,<br />
To harmonies and hues beneath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As tender as its own:<br />
Now all the tree-tops lay asleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like green waves on the sea,<br />
As still as in the silent deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ocean-woods may be.</p>
<p class="poetry">How calm it was!&mdash;The silence there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By such a chain was bound,<br />
That even the busy woodpecker<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made stiller with her sound<br />
The inviolable quietness;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The breath of peace we drew<br />
With its soft motion made not less<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The calm that round us grew.<br />
There seemed, from the remotest seat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the white mountain waste<br />
To the soft flower beneath our feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A magic circle traced,&mdash;<br />
A spirit interfused around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A thrilling silent life;<br />
To momentary peace it bound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mortal nature&rsquo;s strife;&mdash;<br />
<a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>And
still I felt the centre of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The magic circle there<br />
Was one fair form that filled with love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lifeless atmosphere.</p>
<p class="poetry">We paused beside the pools that lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the forest bough;<br />
Each seemed as &rsquo;twere a little sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gulfed in a world below;<br />
A firmament of purple light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which in the dark earth lay,<br />
More boundless than the depth of night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And purer than the day&mdash;<br />
In which the lovely forests grew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the upper air,<br />
More perfect both in shape and hue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than any spreading there.<br />
There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the dark green wood<br />
The white sun twinkling like the dawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of a speckled cloud.<br />
Sweet views, which in our world above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can never well be seen,<br />
Were imaged in the water&rsquo;s love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that fair forest green:<br />
And all was interfused beneath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With an Elysian glow,<br />
An atmosphere without a breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A softer day below.<br />
Like one beloved, the scene had lent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the dark water&rsquo;s breast<br />
Its every leaf and lineament<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With more than truth exprest;<br />
<a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Until an
envious wind crept by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an unwelcome thought<br />
Which from the mind&rsquo;s too faithful eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blots one dear image out.<br />
&mdash;Though thou art ever fair and kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The forests ever green,<br />
Less oft is peace in Shelley&rsquo;s mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than calm in waters seen!</p>

Worship thee with bended knees.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their unremaining gods and they<br />

Where a world of new delights<br />

At your presumption, atom-born!<br />

With the instinct of that spirit<br />

<h3>LIFE OF LIFE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Life</span> of Life! thy
lips enkindle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With their love the breath between them;<br />
And thy smiles before they dwindle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the cold air fire; then screen them<br />
In those looks, where whoso gazes<br />
Faints, entangled in their mazes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Child of Light! thy limbs are burning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thro&rsquo; the vest which seeks to hide them;<br />
As the radiant lines of morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thro&rsquo; the clouds ere they divide them;<br />
And this atmosphere divinest<br />
Shrouds thee wheresoe&rsquo;er thou shinest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fair are others; none beholds thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thy voice sounds low and tender<br />
Like the fairest, for it folds thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the sight, that liquid splendour,<br />
And all feel, yet see thee never,<br />
As I feel now, lost for ever!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Its dim shapes are clad with brightness,<br />
And the souls of whom thou lovest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Walk upon the winds with lightness,<br />
Till they fail, as I am failing,<br />
Dizzy, lost, yet unbewailing!</p>

And the year<br />
On the earth her death-bed, in a shroud of leaves dead,<br />

Trembling hours, she will arise<br />
With new love within her eyes.</p>

When a new planet swims into his ken;<br />
Or like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes</p>

Looked on each other with a wild surmise&mdash;<br />
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</p>

O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close,<br />

From the sick heavens all unseemly stains.<br />
The anxious month, relieved from its pains,<br />

feel of May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eyelids with the passing
coolness play,<br />
Like rose-leaves with the drip of summer rains.<br />
The calmest thoughts come round us&mdash;as of leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budding; fruit ripening in
stillness; autumn suns<br />
Smiling at eve upon the quiet sheaves;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Sappho&rsquo;s cheek; a

The gradual sand that through an hour-glass runs;<br />

&rsquo;Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou, light-winged Dryad of
the trees,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In some melodious plot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,<br />

ease.</p>

Tasting of Flora and the country green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance, and Proven&ccedil;al song, and sunburnt
mirth!<br />
O for a beaker full of the warm South,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With beaded bubbles winking at the
brim,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

dim:</p>
<p class="poetry">Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What thou among the leaves hast never known,<br />
The weariness, the fever, and the fret<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;<br />
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and
dies;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where but to think is to be full
of sorrow<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And leaden-eyed despairs;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or new Love pine at them beyond
to-morrow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away! away! for I will fly to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,<br />
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,<br />

Already with thee! tender is the night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clustered around by all her starry
Fays;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But here there is no light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through verdurous glooms and
winding mossy ways.</p>

The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast-fading violets covered up in
leaves;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And mid-May&rsquo;s eldest child,<br />

summer eves.</p>
<p class="poetry">Darkling I listen; and for many a time<br />

Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme,<br />

Now more than ever seems it rich to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To cease upon the midnight with no pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While thou art pouring forth thy
soul abroad<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In such an ecstasy!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thy high requiem become a
sod.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; No hungry generations tread thee down;<br />
The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br />
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for
home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood in tears amid the alien
corn;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The same that oft-times hath<br />

Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past the near meadows, over the still stream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the hill-side; and now
&rsquo;tis buried deep<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the next valley-glades:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it a vision or a waking dream?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fled is that music:&mdash;Do I
wake or sleep?</p>

Sylvan historian, who canst thus express<br />

What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape<br />

Arcady?<br />
What men or gods are these?&nbsp; What maidens loth?<br />

What little town by river or sea-shore,<br />

Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br />
Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br />
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;<br />
To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,<br />
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br />
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br />
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br />

Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br />
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:<br />

I wandered in a forest thoughtlessly,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Their arms embraced, and their pinions too;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their lips touched not, but had not bade adieu,<br

No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat<br />

O brightest! though too late for antique vows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,<br />
When holy were the haunted forest boughs,<br />

Yet even in these days so far retired<br />

With the wreathed trellis of a working brain,<br />

331</span>NOTES</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Epithalamion</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page3">3</a></span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Written</span> by Spenser on his marriage
in Ireland, in 1594, with Elizabeth Boyle of Kilcoran, who
survived him, married one Roger Seckerstone, and was again a
widow.&nbsp; Dr. Grosart seems to have finally decided the
identity of the heroine of this great poem.&nbsp; It is worth
while to explain, once for all, that I do not use the accented
<i>e</i> for the longer pronunciation of the past
participle.&nbsp; The accent is not an English sign, and, to my
mind, disfigures the verse; neither do I think it necessary to
cut off the <i>e</i> with an apostrophe when the participle is
shortened.&nbsp; The reader knows at a glance how the word is to
be numbered; besides, he may have his preferences where choice is
allowed.&nbsp; In reading such a line as Tennyson&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Dear as
remembered kisses after death,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>one man likes the familiar sound of the word
&lsquo;remembered&rsquo; as we all speak it now; another takes
pleasure in the four light syllables filling the line so
full.&nbsp; Tennyson uses the apostrophe as a rule, but neither
he nor any other author is quite consistent.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Rosalynd&rsquo;s
Madrigal</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page21">21</a></span>.</h3>
<p>It may please the reader to think that this frolic, rich, and
delicate singer was Shakespeare&rsquo;s very Rosalind.&nbsp; From
Dr. Thomas Lodge&rsquo;s novel, <i>Euphues&rsquo; Golden
Legacy</i>, was taken much of the story, with some of the
characters, and some few of the passages, of <i>As You Like
It</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Rosaline</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page22">22</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This splendid poem (from the same romance), written on the
poet&rsquo;s voyage to the Islands of Terceras and the Canaries,
has the fire and freshness of the south and the sea; all its
colours are clear.&nbsp; The reader&rsquo;s ear will at once
teach him to read the sigh &lsquo;heigh ho&rsquo; so as to give
the first syllable the time of two (long and short).</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Farewell to Arms</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page25">25</a></span>.</h3>
<p>George Peele&rsquo;s four fine stanzas (which must be
mentioned as dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, but are better without
that dedication) exist <a name="page332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>in another form, in the first
person, and with some archaisms smoothed.&nbsp; But the third
person seems to be far more touching, the old man himself having
done with verse.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Passionate
Shepherd</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page28">28</a></span>.</h3>
<p>The sixth stanza is perhaps by Izaak Walton.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Take</span>, <span class="smcap">O take
those Lips away</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page44">44</a></span>.</h3>
<p>The author of this exquisite song is by no means
certain.&nbsp; The second stanza is not with the first in
Shakespeare, but it is in Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Kind are her Answers</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page46">46</a></span>.</h3>
<p>These verses are a more subtle experiment in metre by the
musician and poet, Campion, than even the following,
<i>Laura</i>, which he himself sweetly commended as
&lsquo;voluble, and fit to express any amorous
conceit.&rsquo;&nbsp; In <i>Kind are her Answers</i> the long
syllables and the trochaic movement of the short lines meet the
contrary movement of the rest, with an exquisite effect of flux
and reflux.&nbsp; The &lsquo;dancers&rsquo; whose time they sang
must have danced (with Perdita) like &lsquo;a wave of the
sea.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dirge</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page44">44</a></span>.</h3>
<p>I have followed the usual practice in omitting the last and
less beautiful stanza.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Follow</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page49">49</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Campion&rsquo;s &lsquo;airs,&rsquo; for which he wrote his
words, laid rules too urgent upon what would have been a delicate
genius in poetry.&nbsp; The airs demanded so many stanzas; but
they gave his imagination leave to be away, and they depressed
and even confused his metrical play, hurting thus the two vital
spots of poetry.&nbsp; Many of the stanzas for music make an
unlucky repeating pattern with the poor variety that a repeating
wall-paper does not attempt.&nbsp; And yet Campion began again
and again with the onset of a true poet.&nbsp; Take, for example,
the poem beginning with the vitality of this line,
&lsquo;touching in its majesty&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Awake, thou
spring of speaking grace; mute rest becomes not thee!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would have guessed that the piece was to close in a
jogging stanza containing a reflection on the fact that brutes
are speechless, with these two final lines&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If speech be then the best of graces,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doe it not in slumber smother!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>Campion yields a curious collection of beautiful first
lines.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Sleep, angry beauty, sleep and fear not
me&rsquo;</p>
<p>is far finer than anything that follows.&nbsp; So is there a
single gloom in this&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Follow thy fair sun, unhappy
shadow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And a single joy in this&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh, what unhoped-for sweet
supply!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another solitary line is one that by its splendour proves
Campion the author of <i>Cherry Ripe</i>&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;A thousand cherubim fly in her
looks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yet &lsquo;a thousand cherubim&rsquo; is a line of a poem
full of the dullest kind of reasoning&mdash;curious matter for
music&mdash;and of the intricate knotting of what is a very
simple thread of thought.&nbsp; It was therefore no easy matter
to choose something of Campion&rsquo;s for a collection of the
finest work.&nbsp; For an historical book of representative
poetry the question would be easy enough, for there Campion
should appear by his glorious lyric, <i>Cherry Ripe</i>, by one
or two poems of profounder imagination (however imperfect), and
by a madrigal written for the music (however the stanzas may flag
in their quibbling).&nbsp; But the work of choosing among his
lyrics for the sake of beauty shows too clearly the inequality,
the brevity of the inspiration, and the poet&rsquo;s absolute
disregard of the moment of its flight and departure.</p>
<p>A few splendid lines may be reason enough for extracting a
short poem, but must not be made to bear too great a burden.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">When thou must Home</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page50">50</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Of the quality of this imaginative lyric there is no
doubt.&nbsp; It is fine throughout, as we confess even after the
greatness of the opening:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;When thou must home to shades of
underground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there arrived, a new admired
guest&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is as solemn and fantastic at the close as at this dark and
splendid opening, and throughout, past description,
Elizabethan.&nbsp; This single poem must bind Campion to that
period without question; and as he lived thirty-six years in the
actual reign of Elizabeth, and printed his <i>Book of Airs</i>
with Rosseter two years before her death, it is by no violence
that we give him the name that covers our earlier poets of the
great age.&nbsp; <i>When thou must Home</i> is of the day of
Marlowe.&nbsp; It has the qualities of great poetry, and
especially the quality of keeping its simplicity; and it has a
quality of great simplicity not at all child-like, but adult,
large, gay, credulous, tragic, sombre, and amorous.</p>

334</span><span class="smcap">The Funeral</span>.&mdash;Page

<p>Donne, too, is a poet of fine onsets.&nbsp; It was with some
hesitation that I admitted a poem having the middle stanza of
this Funeral; but the earlier lines of the last are fine.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Charis&rsquo; Triumph</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page58">58</a></span>.</h3>
<p>The freshest of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s lyrics have been
chosen.&nbsp; Obviously it is freshness that he generally lacks,
for all his vigour, his emphatic initiative, and his overhearing
and impulsive voice in verse.&nbsp; There is a stale breath in
that hearty shout.&nbsp; Doubtless it is to the credit of his
honesty that he did not adopt the country-phrases in vogue; but
when he takes landscape as a task the effect is ill enough.&nbsp;
I have already had the temerity to find fault, for a blunder of
meaning, with the passage of a most famous lyric, where it says
the contrary of what it would say&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But might I of Jove&rsquo;s nectar
sup<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not change for thine;&rsquo;</p>
<p>and for doing so have encountered the anger rather than the
argument of those who cannot admire a pretty lyric but they must
hold reason itself to be in error rather than allow that a line
of it has chanced to get turned in the rhyming.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">In Earth</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page64">64</a></span>.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw anything,&rsquo; says Charles Lamb,
&lsquo;like this funeral dirge, except the ditty which reminds
Ferdinand of his drowned father in the <i>Tempest</i>.&nbsp; As
that is of the water, watery; so this is of the earth,
earthy.&nbsp; Both have that intentness of feeling which seems to
resolve itself into the element which it contemplates.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Song</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page65">65</a></span>.</h3>
<p>All Drummond&rsquo;s poems seem to be minor poems, even at
their finest, except only this.&nbsp; He must have known, for the
creation of that poem, some more impassioned and less restless
hour.&nbsp; It is, from the outset to the close, the sigh of a
profound expectation.&nbsp; There is no division into stanzas,
because its metre is the breath of life.&nbsp; One might wish
that the English ode (roughly called &lsquo;Pindaric&rsquo;) had
never been written but with passion, for so written it is the
most immediate of all metres; the shock of the heart and the
breath of elation or grief are the law of the lines.&nbsp; It has
passed out of the gates of the garden of stanzas, and walks (not
astray) in the further freedom where all is interior law.&nbsp;
Cowley, long afterwards, wrote this Pindaric ode, and wrote it
coldly.&nbsp; But Drummond&rsquo;s (he calls it a song) can never
again be forgotten.&nbsp; With admirable judgment it was set up
at the very gate of that <i>Golden Treasury</i> we all know so
well; and, therefore, generation after <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>generation
of readers, who have never opened Drummond&rsquo;s poems, know
this fine ode as well as they know any single poem in the whole
of English literature.&nbsp; There was a generation that had not
been taught by the <i>Golden Treasury</i>, and Cardinal Newman
was of it.&nbsp; Writing to Coventry Patmore of his great odes,
he called them beautiful but fragmentary; was inclined to wish
that they might some day be made complete.&nbsp; There is nothing
in all poetry more complete.&nbsp; Seldom is a poem in stanzas so
complete but that another stanza might have made a final close;
but a master&rsquo;s ode has the unity of life, and when it ends
it ends for ever.</p>
<p>A poem of Drummond&rsquo;s has this auroral image of a blush:
Anthea has blushed to hear her eyes likened to stars (habit might
have caused her, one would think, to hear the flattery with a
front as cool as the very daybreak), and the lover tells her that
the sudden increase of her beauty is futile, for he cannot admire
more: &lsquo;For naught thy cheeks that morn do
raise.&rsquo;&nbsp; What sweet, nay, what solemn roses!</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Me here she first perceived, and here a
morn<br />
Of bright carnations overspread her face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The seventeenth century has possession of that
&lsquo;morn&rsquo; caught once upon its uplands; nor can any
custom of aftertime touch its freshness to wither it.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">To my Inconstant
Mistress</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page75">75</a></span>.</h3>
<p>The solemn vengeance of this poem has a strange tone&mdash;not
unique, for it had sounded somewhere in medi&aelig;val poetry in
Italy&mdash;but in a dreadful sense divine.&nbsp; At the first
reading, this sentence against inconstancy, spoken by one more
than inconstant, moves something like indignation; nevertheless,
it is menacingly and obscurely justified, on a ground as it were
beyond the common region of tolerance and pardon.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Pulley</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page91">91</a></span>.</h3>
<p>An editor is greatly tempted to mend a word in these exquisite
verses.&nbsp; George Herbert was maladroit in using the word
&lsquo;rest&rsquo; in two senses.&nbsp; &lsquo;Peace&rsquo; is
not quite so characteristic a word, but it ought to take the
place of &lsquo;rest&rsquo; in the last line of the second
stanza; so then the first line of the last stanza would not have
this rather distressing ambiguity.&nbsp; The poem is otherwise
perfect beyond description.</p>

<p>George Herbert&rsquo;s work is so perfectly a box where
thoughts &lsquo;compacted lie,&rsquo; that no one is moved, in
reading his rich poetry, to detach a line, so fine and so
significant are its neighbours; nevertheless, it may be well to
stop the reader at such a lovely passage as this&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;He was a garden
in a Paradise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is nothing else of Waller&rsquo;s fine enough to be
admitted here; and even this, though unquestionably a beautiful
poem, elastic in words and fresh in feeling, despite its wearied
argument, is of the third-class.&nbsp; Greatness seems generally,
in the arts, to be of two kinds, and the third rank is less than
great.&nbsp; The wearied argument of <i>The Rose</i> is the
almost squalid plea of all the poets, from Ronsard to Herrick:
&lsquo;Time is short; they make the better bargain who make haste
to love.&rsquo;&nbsp; This thrifty business and essentially cold
impatience was&mdash;time out of mind&mdash;unknown to the truer
love; it is larger, illiberal, untender, and without all
dignity.&nbsp; The poets were wrong to give their verses the
message of so sorry a warning.&nbsp; There is only one thing that
persuades you to forgive the paltry plea of the poet that time is
brief&mdash;and that is the charming reflex glimpse it gives of
her to whom the rose and the verse were sent, and who had not
thought that time was brief.</p>

<p>The sock represents the stage, in <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>, for
comedy, and the buskin, in <i>Il Penseroso</i>, for
tragedy.&nbsp; Milton seems to think the comic drama in England
needs no apology, but he hesitates at the tragic.&nbsp; The poet
of <i>King Lear</i> is named for his sweetness and his wood-notes
wild.</p>

<p>Most of the allusions in <i>Lycidas</i> need no explaining to
readers of poetry.&nbsp; The geography is that of the western
coasts from furthest north to Cornwall.&nbsp; Deva is the Dee;
&lsquo;the great vision&rsquo; means the apparition of the
Archangel, St. Michael, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount; Namancos
and Bayona face the mount from the continental coast; Bellerus
stands for Belerium, the Land&rsquo;s End.</p>
<p>Arethusa and Mincius&mdash;Sicilian and Italian
streams&mdash;represent the pastoral poetry of Theocritus and
Virgil.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fair and flagrant things&rsquo;&mdash;Crashaw&rsquo;s
own phrase&mdash;might serve for a brilliant and fantastic praise
and protest in description of his own verses.&nbsp; In the last
century, despite the opinion of a few, and despite the fact that
Pope took possession of Crashaw&rsquo;s line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Obedient
slumbers that can wake and weep,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and for some time of the present century, the critics had a
wintry word to blame him with.&nbsp; They said of George Herbert,
of Lovelace, <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>of Crashaw, and of other light hearts of the
seventeenth century&mdash;not so much that their inspiration was
in bad taste, as that no reader of taste could suffer them.&nbsp;
A better opinion on that company of poets is that they had a
taste extraordinarily liberal, generous, and elastic, but not
essentially lax: taste that gave now and then too much room to
play, but anon closed with the purest and exactest laws of
temperance and measure.&nbsp; The extravagance of Crashaw is a
far more lawful thing than the extravagance of Addison, whom some
believe to have committed none; moreover, Pope and all the
politer poets nursed something they were pleased to call a
&lsquo;rage,&rsquo; and this expatiated (to use another word of
their own) beyond all bounds.&nbsp; Of sheer voluntary extremes
it is not in the seventeenth century conceit that we should seek
examples, but in an eighteenth century &lsquo;rage.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A &lsquo;noble rage,&rsquo; properly provoked, could be backed to
write more trash than fancy ever tempted the half-incredulous
sweet poet of the older time to run upon.&nbsp; He was
fancy&rsquo;s child, and the bard of the eighteenth century was
the child of common sense with straws in his hair&mdash;vainly
arranged there.&nbsp; The eighteenth century was never content
with a moderate mind; it invented &lsquo;rage&rsquo;; it matched
rage with a flagrant diction mingled of Latin words and simple
English words made vacant and ridiculous, and these were the
worst; it was resolved to be behind no century in
passion&mdash;nay, to show the way, to fire the nations.&nbsp;
Addison taught himself, as his hero taught the battle,
&lsquo;where to rage&rsquo;; and in the later years of the same
literary age, Johnson summoned the lapsed and absent fury, with
no kind of misgiving as to the resulting verse.&nbsp; Take such a
phrase as &lsquo;the madded land&rsquo;; there, indeed, is a word
coined by the noble rage as the last century evoked it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The madded land&rsquo; is a phrase intended to prove that
the law-giver of taste, Johnson himself, could lodge the fury in
his breast when opportunity occurred.&nbsp; &lsquo;And dubious
title shakes the madded land.&rsquo;&nbsp; It would be hard to
find anything, even in Addison, more flagrant and less fair.</p>
<p>Take <i>The Weeper</i> of Crashaw&mdash;his most flagrant
poem.&nbsp; Its follies are all sweet-humoured, they smile.&nbsp;
Its beauties are a quick and abundant shower.&nbsp; The delicate
phrases are so mingled with the flagrant that it is difficult to
quote them without rousing that general sense of humour of which
any one may make a boast; and I am therefore shy even of citing
the &lsquo;brisk cherub&rsquo; who has early sipped the
Saint&rsquo;s tear: &lsquo;Then to his music,&rsquo; in
Crashaw&rsquo;s divinely simple phrase; and his singing
&lsquo;tastes of this breakfast all day long.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sorrow
is a queen, he cries to the Weeper, and when sorrow would be seen
in state, &lsquo;then is she drest by none but thee.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then you come upon the fancy, &lsquo;Fountain and garden in one
face.&rsquo;&nbsp; All places, times, and objects are &lsquo;Thy
tears&rsquo; sweet opportunity.&rsquo;&nbsp; If these charming
passages lurk in his worst poems, the reader of this anthology
will not be able to count them in his best.&nbsp; In the Epiphany
Hymn the heavens have found means</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To disinherit the sun&rsquo;s rise,<br />
Delicately to displace<br />
The day, and plant it fairer in thy face.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span><i>To
the Morning</i>: <i>Satisfaction for Sleep</i>, is, all through,
luminous.&nbsp; It would he difficult to find, even in the orient
poetry of that time, more daylight or more spirit.&nbsp; True, an
Elizabethan would not have had poetry so rich as in
<i>Love&rsquo;s Horoscope</i>, but yet an Elizabethan would have
had it no fresher.&nbsp; The <i>Hymn to St. Teresa</i> has the
brevities which this poet&mdash;reproached with his
<i>longueurs</i>&mdash;masters so well.&nbsp; He tells how the
Spanish girl, six years old, set out in search of death:
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s for the Moors and Martyrdom.&nbsp; Sweet, not
so fast!&rsquo;&nbsp; Of many contemporary songs in pursuit of a
fugitive Cupid, Crashaw&rsquo;s <i>Cupid&rsquo;s Cryer</i>:
<i>out of the Greek</i>, is the most dainty.&nbsp; But if readers
should be a little vexed with the poet&rsquo;s light heart and
perpetual pleasure, with the late ripeness of his sweetness,
here, for their satisfaction, is a passage capable of the great
age that had lately closed when Crashaw wrote.&nbsp; It is in his
summons to nature and art:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come, and come strong,<br />
To the conspiracy of our spacious song!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been obliged to take courage to alter the reading of
the seventeenth and nineteenth lines of the <i>Prayer-Book</i>,
so as to make them intelligible; they had been obviously
misprinted.&nbsp; I have also found it necessary to re-punctuate
generally.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">On the Death of Mr.
Crashaw</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page157">157</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This ode has been chosen as more nobly representative than
that, better known, <i>On the Death of Mr. William
Harvey</i>.&nbsp; In the Crashaw ode, and in the <i>Hymn to the
Light</i>, Cowley is, at last, tender.&nbsp; But it cannot be
said that his love-poems had tenderness.&nbsp; He wrote in a gay
language, but added nothing to its gaiety.&nbsp; He wrote the
language of love, and left it cooler than he found it.&nbsp; What
the conceits of Lovelace and the rest&mdash;flagrant, not
frigid&mdash;did not do was done by Cowley&rsquo;s quenching
breath; the language of love began to lose by him.&nbsp; But even
then, even then, who could have foretold what the loss at a later
day would be!</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hymn to the Light</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page159">159</a></span>.</h3>
<p>It is somewhat to be regretted that this splendid poem should
show Cowley as the writer of the alexandrine that divides into
two lines.&nbsp; For he it was who first used (or first
conspicuously used) the alexandrine that is organic, integral,
and itself a separate unit of metre.&nbsp; He first passed beyond
the heroic line, or at least he first used the alexandrine
freely, at his pleasure, amid heroic verse; and after him <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>Dryden took
possession and then Pope.&nbsp; But both these masters, when they
wrote alexandrines, wrote them in the French manner,
divided.&nbsp; Cowley, however, with admirable art, is able to
prevent even an accidental pause, making the middle of his line
fall upon the middle of some word that is rapid in the speaking
and therefore indivisible by pause or even by any
lingering.&nbsp; Take this one instance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Like some fair
pine o&rsquo;erlooking all the ignobler wood.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Cowley&rsquo;s delicate example had ruled in English poetry
(and he surely had authority on this one point, at least), this
alexandrine would have taken its own place as an important line
of English metre, more mobile than the heroic, less fitted to
epic or dramatic poetry, but a line liberally lyrical.&nbsp; It
would have been the light, pursuing wave that runs suddenly,
outrunning twenty, further up the sands than these, a swift
traveller, unspent, of longer impulse, of more impetuous foot, of
fuller and of hastier breath, more eager to speak, and yet more
reluctant to have done.&nbsp; Cowley left the line with all this
lyrical promise within it, and if his example had been followed,
English prosody would have had in this a valuable bequest.</p>
<p>Cowley probably was two or three years younger than Richard
Crashaw, and the alexandrine is to be found&mdash;to be found by
searching&mdash;in Crashaw; and he took precisely the same care
as Cowley that the long wand of that line should not give way in
the middle&mdash;should be strong and supple and should
last.&nbsp; Here are four of his alexandrines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Or you, more noble architects of
intellectual noise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of sweets you have, and murmur that you have no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And everlasting series of a deathless song.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To all the dear-bought nations this redeeming
name.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A later poet&mdash;Coventry Patmore&mdash;wrote a far longer
line than even these&mdash;a line not only speeding further, but
speeding with a more celestial movement than Cowley or Crashaw
heard with the ear of dreams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He unhappily adopted,&rsquo; says Dr. Johnson as to
Cowley&rsquo;s diction, &lsquo;that which was
predominant.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That which was
predominant&rsquo; was as good a vintage of English language as
the cycles of history have ever brought to pass.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">To Lucasta</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page163">163</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Colonel Richard Lovelace, an enchanting poet, is hardly read,
except for two poems which are as famous as any in our
language.&nbsp; Perhaps the rumour of his conceits has frightened
his reader.&nbsp; It must be granted they are now and then
daunting; there is a poem on &lsquo;Princess Louisa
Drawing&rsquo; which is a very maze; the little paths of verse
and fancy turn in upon one another, and the turns are <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>pointed
with artificial shouts of joy and surprise.&nbsp; But, again,
what a reader unused to a certain living symbolism will be apt to
take for a careful and cold conceit is, in truth, a
rapture&mdash;none graver, none more fiery or more
luminous.&nbsp; But even to name the poem where these occur might
be to deliver delicate and ardent poetry over to the general
sense of humour, which one distrusts.&nbsp; Nor is Lovelace easy
reading at any time (the two or three famous poems
excepted).&nbsp; The age he adorned lived in constant readiness
for the fiddler.&nbsp; Eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning was as
good an hour as another for a dance, and poetry, too, was gay
betimes, but intricate with figures.&nbsp; It is the very order,
the perspective, as it were, of the movement that seems to baffle
the eye, but the game was a free impulse.&nbsp; Since the first
day danced with the first night, no dancing was more
natural&mdash;at least to a dancer of genius.&nbsp; True, the
dance could be tyrannous.&nbsp; It was an importunate
fashion.&nbsp; When the Bishop of Hereford, compelled by Robin
Hood, in merry Barnsdale, danced in his boots (&lsquo;and glad he
could so get away&rsquo;), he was hardly in worse heart or trim
than a seventeenth century author here and there whose original
seriousness or work-a-day piety would have been content to go
plodding flat-foot or halting, as the muse might naturally
incline with him, but whom the tune, the grace, and gallantry of
the time beckoned to tread a perpetual measure.&nbsp; Lovelace
was a dancer of genius; nay, he danced to rest his wings, for he
was winged, cap and heel.&nbsp; The fiction of flight has lost
its charm long since.&nbsp; Modern art grew tired of the idea,
now turned to commonplace, and painting took leave of the buoyant
urchins&mdash;naughty cherub and Cupid together; but the
seventeenth century was in love with that old fancy&mdash;more in
love, perhaps, than any century in the past.&nbsp; Its late
painters, whose human figures had no lack of weight upon the
comfortable ground, yet kept a sense of buoyancy for this
hovering childhood, and kept the angels and the loves aloft, as
though they shook a tree to make a flock of birds flutter up.</p>
<p>Fine is the fantastic and infrequent landscape in
Lovelace&rsquo;s poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This is the palace of the wood,<br />
And court o&rsquo; the royal oak, where stood<br />
The whole nobility.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In more than one place Lucasta&rsquo;s, or Amarantha&rsquo;s,
or Laura&rsquo;s hair is sprinkled with dew or rain almost as
freshly and wildly as in Wordsworth&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>Lovelace, who loved freedom, seems to be enclosed in so narrow
a book; yet it is but a &lsquo;hermitage.&rsquo;&nbsp; To shake
out the light and spirit of its leaves is to give a glimpse of
liberty not to him, but to the world.</p>
<p>In <i>To Lucasta</i> I have been bold to alter, at the close,
&lsquo;you&rsquo; to &lsquo;thou.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lovelace sent his
verses out unrevised, and the inconsistency of pronouns is common
with him, but nowhere else so distressing as in this brief and
otherwise perfect poem.&nbsp; The fault is easily set right, and
it seems even an unkindness not to lend him this redress, offered
him here as an act of comradeship.</p>

Obsequies</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page165">165</a></span>.</h3>
<p>That errors should abound in the text of Lovelace is the more
lamentable because he was apt to make a play of phrases that
depend upon the precision of a comma&mdash;nay, upon the
precision of the voice in reading.&nbsp; <i>Lucasta Paying her
Obsequies</i> is a poem that makes a kind of dainty confusion
between the two vestals&mdash;the living and the dead; they are
&lsquo;equal virgins,&rsquo; and you must assign the pronouns
carefully to either as you read.&nbsp; This, read twice, must
surely be placed amongst the loveliest of his lovely
writings.&nbsp; It is a joy to meet such a phrase as &lsquo;her
brave eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">To Althea</span>, <span
class="smcap">from Prison</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page166">166</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This is a poem that takes the winds with an answering
flight.&nbsp; Should they be &lsquo;birds&rsquo; or
&lsquo;gods&rsquo; that wanton in the air in the first of these
gallant stanzas?&nbsp; Bishop Percy shied at &lsquo;gods,&rsquo;
and with admirable judgment suggested &lsquo;birds,&rsquo; an
amendment adopted by the greater number of succeeding editors,
until one or two wished for the other phrase again, as an
audacity fit for Lovelace.&nbsp; But the Bishop&rsquo;s misgiving
was after all justified by one of the <span
class="GutSmall">MSS.</span> of the poem, in which the
&lsquo;gods&rsquo; proved to be &lsquo;birds&rsquo; long before
he changed them.&nbsp; The reader may ask, what is there to
choose between birds so divine and gods so light?&nbsp; But to
begin with &lsquo;gods&rsquo; would be to make an anticlimax of
the close.&nbsp; Lovelace led from birds and fishes to winds, and
from winds to angels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When linnet-like confined&rsquo; is another modern
reading.&nbsp; &lsquo;When, like committed linnets,&rsquo;
daunted the eighteenth century.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is right
seventeenth century, and is now happily restored; happily,
because Lovelace would not have the word &lsquo;confined&rsquo;
twice in this little poem.</p>
<h3>A <span class="smcap">Horatian Ode</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page169">169</a></span>.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;He earned the glorious name,&rsquo; says a biographer
of Andrew Marvell (editing an issue of that post&rsquo;s works
which certainly has its faults), &lsquo;of the British
Aristides.&rsquo;&nbsp; The portly dulness of the mind that could
make such a phrase, and having made, award it, is not, in
fairness, to affect a reader&rsquo;s thought of Marvell himself
nor even of his time.&nbsp; Under correction, I should think that
the award was not made in his own age; he did but live on the eve
of the day that cumbered its mouth with phrases of such foolish
burden and made literature stiff with them.&nbsp; Andrew
Marvell&rsquo;s political rectitude, it is true, seems to have
been of a robustious kind; but his poetry, at its rare best, has
a &lsquo;wild civility,&rsquo; which might puzzle the triumph of
him, whoever he was, who made a success of this phrase of the
&lsquo;British Aristides.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nay, it is difficult not
to think that Marvell too, who was &lsquo;of middling stature,
roundish-faced, cherry-cheeked,&rsquo; a healthy and active
rather than a spiritual Aristides, might himself <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>have been
somewhat taken by surprise at the encounters of so subtle a
muse.&nbsp; He, as a garden-poet, expected the accustomed Muse to
lurk about the fountain-heads, within the caves, and by the walks
and the statues of the gods, keeping the tryst of a seventeenth
century convention in which there were certainly no
surprises.&nbsp; And for fear of the commonplaces of those
visits, Marvell sometimes outdoes the whole company of
garden-poets in the difficult labours of the fancy.&nbsp; The
reader treads with him a &lsquo;maze&rsquo; most resolutely
intricate, and is more than once obliged to turn back, having
been too much puzzled on the way to a small, visible, plain, and
obvious goal of thought.</p>
<p>And yet this poet two or three times did meet a Muse he had
hardly looked for among the trodden paths; a spiritual creature
had been waiting behind a laurel or an apple-tree.&nbsp; You find
him coming away from such a divine ambush a wilder and a simpler
man.&nbsp; All his garden had been made ready for poetry, and
poetry was indeed there, but in unexpected hiding and in a
strange form, looking rather like a fugitive, shy of the poet who
was conscious of having her rules by heart, yet sweetly willing
to be seen, for all her haste.</p>
<p>The political poems, needless to say, have an excellence of a
different character and a higher degree.&nbsp; They have so much
authentic dignity that &lsquo;the glorious name of the British
Aristides&rsquo; really seems duller when it is conferred as the
earnings of the <i>Horatian Ode upon Cromwell&rsquo;s Return from
Ireland</i> than when it inappropriately clings to Andrew
Marvell, cherry-cheeked, caught in the tendrils of his vines and
melons.&nbsp; He shall be, therefore, the British Aristides in
those moments of midsummer solitude; at least, the heavy phrase
shall then have the smile it never sought.</p>
<p>The Satires are, of course, out of reach for their inordinate
length.&nbsp; The celebrated Satire on Holland certainly makes
the utmost of the fun to be easily found in the physical facts of
the country whose people &lsquo;with mad labour fished the land
to shore.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Satire on &lsquo;Flecno&rsquo; makes
the utmost of another joke we know of&mdash;that of famine.&nbsp;
Flecno, it will be remembered, was a poet, and poor; but the joke
of his bad verses was hardly needed, so fine does Marvell find
that of his hunger.&nbsp; Perhaps there is no age of English
satire that does not give forth the sound of that laughter
unknown to savages&mdash;that craven laughter.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Picture of T. C. in a Prospect of

href="#page173">173</a></span>.</h3>
<p>The presence of a furtive irony of the sweetest kind is the
sure sign of the visit of that unlooked-for muse.&nbsp; With all
spirit and subtlety does Marvell pretend to offer the little girl
T. C. (the future &lsquo;virtuous enemy of man&rsquo;) the
prophetic homage of the habitual poets.&nbsp; The poem closes
with an impassioned tenderness not to be found elsewhere in
Marvell.</p>

<p>One of our true poets, and the first who looked at nature with
the full spiritual intellect, Henry Vaughan was known to few but
students until Mr. E. K. Chambers gave us his excellent
edition.&nbsp; The tender wit and grave play of Herbert,
Crashaw&rsquo;s lovely rapture, are all unlike this meditation of
a soul condemned and banished into life.&nbsp; Vaughan&rsquo;s
imagination suddenly opens a new window towards the east.&nbsp;
The age seems to change with him, and it is one of the most
incredible of all facts that there should be more than a
century&mdash;and such a century!&mdash;from him to
Wordsworth.&nbsp; The passing of time between them is strange
enough, but the passing of Pope, Prior, and Gray&mdash;of the
world, the world, whether reasonable or flippant or
rhetorical&mdash;is more strange.&nbsp; Vaughan&rsquo;s phrase
and diction seem to carry the light.&nbsp; <i>Il vous semble que
cette femme d&eacute;gage de la lumi&egrave;re en
marchant</i>?&nbsp; <i>Vous l&rsquo;aimez</i>! says Marius in

to be by a sense of light that we know the muse we are to
love.</p>

poetry&mdash;rare in even the best folk-songs.&nbsp; Such
passages do not occur but in ballads that are throughout on the

separable quality in literature, and it is not in that illusion
that the style of the opening of Aphra Behn&rsquo;s resounding
song is to be praised.&nbsp; But it <i>is</i> the
style&mdash;implying the reckless and majestic heart&mdash;that
first takes the reader of these great verses.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hymn</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page209">209</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Whether Addison wrote the whole of this or not,&mdash;and it
seems that the inspired passages are none of his&mdash;it is to
me a poem of genius, magical in spite of the limited diction.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate
Lady</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page210">210</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Also in spite of limited diction&mdash;the sign of thought
closing in, as it did fast close in during those years&mdash;are
Pope&rsquo;s tenderness and passion communicated in this
beautiful elegy.&nbsp; It would not be too much to say that all
his passion, all his tenderness, and certainly all his mystery,
are in the few lines at the opening and close.&nbsp; The
<i>Epistle of Eloisa</i> is (artistically speaking) but a
counterfeit.&nbsp; Yet Pope&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i> begins by
stealing and translating into the false elegance of altered taste
that lovely and poetic opening of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What beckoning ghost, besprent with April
dew,<br />
Hails me so solemnly to yonder yew?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the gravity, all the sweetness, one might fear, must be
lost in such a change as Pope makes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What beckoning ghost along the moonlight
shade<br />
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet they are not lost.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s awe and ardour are
authentic, and they prevail; the succeeding
couplet&mdash;inimitably modulated, and of tragic
dignity&mdash;proves, without delay, the quality of the
poem.&nbsp; The poverty and coldness of the passage (towards the
end), in which the roses and the angels are somewhat trivially
sung, cannot mar so veritable an utterance.&nbsp; The four final
couplets are the very glory of the English couplet.</p>
<h3><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span><span class="smcap">Lines on Receiving his
Mother&rsquo;s Picture</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page213">213</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Cowper, again, by the very directness of human feeling makes
his narrowing English a means of absolutely direct
communication.&nbsp; Of all his works (and this is my own mere
and unshared opinion) this single one deserves immortality.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Life</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page217">217</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This fragment (the only fragment, properly so called, in the
present collection) so pleased Wordsworth that he wished he had
written the lines.&nbsp; They are very gently touched.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Land of Dreams</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page217">217</a></span>.</h3>
<p>When Blake writes of sleep and dreams he writes under the very
influence of the hours of sleep&mdash;with a waking consciousness
of the wilder emotion of the dream.&nbsp; Corot painted so, when
at summer dawn he went out and saw landscape in the hours of
sleep.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Surprised by Joy</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page229">229</a></span>.</h3>
<p>It is not necessary to write notes on Wordsworth&rsquo;s
sonnets&mdash;the greatest sonnets in our literature; but it
would be well to warn editors how they print this one sonnet;
&lsquo;I wished to share the transport&rsquo; is by no means an
uncommon reading.&nbsp; Into the history of the variant I have
not looked.&nbsp; It is enough that all the suddenness, all the
clash and recoil of these impassioned lines are lost by that
&lsquo;wished&rsquo; in the place of &lsquo;turned.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The loss would be the less tolerable in as much as perhaps only
here and in that heart-moving poem, <i>&rsquo;Tis said that some
have died for love</i>, is Wordsworth to be confessed as an
impassioned poet.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Stepping Westward</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page243">243</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This and the preceding two exquisite poems of sympathy are far
more justified, more recollected and sincere than is that more
monumental composition, the famous poem of sympathy, <i>Hartleap
Well</i>.&nbsp; The most beautiful stanzas of this poem
last-named are so rebuked by the truths of nature that they must
ever stand as obstacles to the straightforward view of sensitive
eyes upon the natural world.&nbsp; Wordsworth shows us the ruins
of an aspen-wood, a blighted hollow, a dreary place forlorn
because an innocent creature, hunted, had there broken its heart
in a leap from the rocks above; grass would not grow, nor shade
linger there&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This beast not unobserved by Nature
fell,<br />
His death was mourned by sympathy divine.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the signs of that sympathy are cruelly asserted to be
these arid woodland ruins&mdash;cruelly, because the common sight
of the day <a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>blossoming over the agonies of animals and birds is
made less tolerable by such fictions.&nbsp; We have to shut our
ears to the benign beauty of this stanza especially&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Being that is in the clouds and air,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is in the green leaves among the groves,<br />
Maintains a deep and reverential care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the unoffending creature whom He
loves.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must shut our ears because the poet offers us, as a proof
of that &lsquo;reverential care,&rsquo; the visible alteration of
nature at the scene of suffering&mdash;an alteration we are
obliged to dispense with every day we pass in the woods.&nbsp; We
are tempted to ask whether Wordsworth himself believed in a
sympathy he asks us&mdash;upon such grounds!&mdash;to believe
in?&nbsp; Did he think his faith to be worthy of no more than a
fictitious sign or a false proof?</p>
<p>To choose from Wordsworth is to draw close a net with very
large meshes&mdash;so that the lovely things that escape must
doubtless cause the reader to protest; but the poems gathered
here are not only supremely beautiful but exceedingly
Wordsworthian.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Youth and Age</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page256">256</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Close to the marvellous <i>Kubla Khan</i>&mdash;a poem that
wrests the secret of dreams and brings it to the light of
verse&mdash;I place <i>Youth and Age</i> as the best specimen of
Coleridge&rsquo;s poetry that is quite undelirious&mdash;to my
mind the only fine specimen.&nbsp; I do not rate his undelirious
poems highly, and even this, charming and nimble as it is, seems
to me rather lean in thought and image.&nbsp; The tenderness of
some of the images comes to a rather lamentable close; the
likeness to &lsquo;some poor nigh-related guest&rsquo; with the
three lines that follow is too squalid for poetry, or prose, or
thought.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page258">258</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This poem is surely more full of a certain quality of extreme
poetry&mdash;the simplest &lsquo;flower of the mind,&rsquo; the
most single magic&mdash;than any other in our language.&nbsp; But
the reader must be permitted to call the story silly.</p>
<h4>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page265">265</a></span>.</h4>
<p>Coleridge used the sun, moon, and stars as a great dream uses
them when the sleeping imagination is obscurely threatened with
illness.&nbsp; All through <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> we see them
like apparitions.&nbsp; It is a pity that he followed the pranks
also of a dream when he impossibly placed a star <i>within</i>
the tip of the crescent.</p>
<h4>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page266">266</a></span>.</h4>
<p>The likeness of &lsquo;the ribbed sea sand&rsquo; is said to
be the one passage actually composed by Wordsworth,&mdash;who
according to the first plan should have written <i>The Ancient
Mariner</i> with Coleridge&mdash;<a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>&lsquo;and perhaps the most
beautiful passage in the poem,&rsquo; adds one critic after
another.&nbsp; It is no more than a good likeness, and has
nothing whatever of the indescribable Coleridge quality.</p>
<p>Coleridge reveals, throughout this poem, an exaltation of the
senses, which is the most poetical thing that can befall a simple
poet.&nbsp; It is necessary only to refer, for sight, to the
stanza on &lsquo;the moving Moon&rsquo; at the bottom of page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page267">267</a></span>; for
hearing, to the supernatural stanzas on page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page271">271</a></span>; and, for
touch, to the line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;And still my
body drank.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="smcap">Rose Aylmer</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page281">281</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Never was a human name more exquisitely sung than in these
perfect stanzas.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Isles of Greece</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page286">286</a></span>.</h3>
<p>One really fine and poetic stanza&mdash;of course, the third;
three stanzas that are good eloquence&mdash;the fourth, fifth,
and seventh; and one that is a fair bit of argument&mdash;the
tenth&mdash;may together perhaps carry the rest.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hellas</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page290">290</a></span>.</h3>
<p>The profounder spirit of Shelley&rsquo;s poem yet leaves it a
careless piece of work in comparison with Byron&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The two false rhymes at the outset may not be of great
importance, but there is something annoying in the dissyllabic
rhymes of the second stanza.&nbsp; Dissyllabic rhymes are
beautiful and enriching when they fall in the right place; that
is, where there is a pause for the second little syllable to
stand.&nbsp; For example, they could not be better placed than
they would have been at the end of the shorter lines of this same
stanza, where they would have dropped into a part of the
pause.&nbsp; Another sin of sheer heedlessness&mdash;the lapse of
grammar in <i>The Skylark</i>, at the top of page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page296">296</a></span>&mdash;will
remind the reader of the special habitual error of Drummond of
Hawthornden.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Waning Moon</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page298">298</a></span>.</h3>
<p>In these few lines the Shelley spirit seems to be more intense
than in any other passage as brief.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Ode to the West Wind</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page299">299</a></span>.</h3>
<p>This magnificent poem is surely the greatest of a great
post&rsquo;s writings, and one of the most splendid poems on
nature and on poetry in a literature resounding with odes on
these enormous themes.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Invitation</span>.&mdash;Page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page303">303</a></span>.</h3>
<p>No need to point to a poem that so shines as does this lucent
verse.</p>
<h3><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span><span class="smcap">La Belle Dame bans
Merci</span>.&mdash;Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page316">316</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Keats is here the magical poet, as he is the intellectual poet
in the great sonnet following; and it is his possession or
promise of both imaginations that proves him greater than
Coleridge.&nbsp; In his day they seem to have found Coleridge to
be a thinker in his poetry.&nbsp; To me he seems to have had
nothing but senses, magic, and simplicity, and these he had to
the utmost yet known to man.&nbsp; Keats was to have been a great
intellectual poet, besides all that in fact he was.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Ode to a Nightingale</span>.&mdash;Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page320">320</a></span>.</h3>
<p>Of the five odes of Keats, the <i>Nightingale</i> is perhaps
the most perfect, and certainly the most imaginative.&nbsp; But
the <i>Grecian Urn</i> is the finest, even though it has fancy
rather than imagination, for never was fancy more
exquisite.&nbsp; The most conspicuous idea&mdash;the emptying of
the town because its folk are away at play in the tale of the
antique urn&mdash;is merely a fancy, and a most antic
fancy&mdash;a prank; it is an irony of man, a rallying of art, a
mockery of time, a burlesque of poetry, divine with
tenderness.&nbsp; The six lines in which this fancy sports are
amongst the loveliest in all literature: the &lsquo;little
town,&rsquo; the &lsquo;peaceful citadel,&rsquo;&mdash;were ever
simple adjectives more happy?&nbsp; But John Keats&rsquo;s final
moral here is undeniably a failure; it says so much and means so
little.&nbsp; The <i>Ode to Autumn</i> is an exterior ode, and
not in so high a rank, but lovely and perfect.&nbsp; The
<i>Psyche</i> I love the least, because its fancy is rather weak
and its sentiment effusive.&nbsp; It has a touch of the deadly
sickliness of <i>Endymion</i>.&nbsp; None the less does it remain
just within the group of the really fine odes of English
poets.&nbsp; The eloquent <i>Melancholy</i> more narrowly escapes
exclusion from that group.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
